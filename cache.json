Due to the\nscarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained\ntransformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are\nstill limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high\ncomputation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D\nmodels, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce\nAny2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models\n(vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from\nany source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection\nstrategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions\nwithin the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token\nwith a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D\ngeometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the\ntransformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each\ntransformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial\nknowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D\ntokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We\nconduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of\nour method.

To maintain high performance while\nrepresenting multiple languages, multilingual models ideally align\nrepresentations, allowing what is learned in one language to generalise to\nothers. Prior research has emphasised the importance of parallel data and\nshared vocabulary elements as key factors for such alignment. In this study, we\ninvestigate an unintuitive novel driver of cross-lingual generalisation:\nlanguage imbalance. In controlled experiments on perfectly equivalent cloned\nlanguages, we observe that the existence of a predominant language during\ntraining boosts the performance of less frequent languages and leads to\nstronger alignment of model representations across languages. Furthermore, we\nfind that this trend is amplified with scale: with large enough models or long\nenough training, we observe that bilingual training data with a 90/10 language\nsplit yields better performance on both languages than a balanced 50/50 split.\nBuilding on these insights, we design training schemes that can improve\nperformance in all cloned languages, even without altering the training data.\nAs we extend our analysis to real languages, we find that infrequent languages\nstill benefit from frequent ones, yet whether language imbalance causes\ncross-lingual generalisation there is not conclusive.\n","authors":["Anton Schäfer","Shauli Ravfogel","Thomas Hofmann","Tiago Pimentel","Imanol Schlag"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07982v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07981v1","updated":"2024-04-11T17:57:32Z","published":"2024-04-11T17:57:32Z","title":"Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search\nengines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries.\nCustomers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for\nquick and easy purchase decisions.

To address this issue, we introduce\nOSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for\nmultimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and\ninteractive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows,\nand macOS. OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for\nassessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications.\nBuilding upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving\nreal web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning\nmultiple applications.

Therefore, automated theorem\nproving of Olympiad-level geometry problems is considered a notable milestone\nin human-level automated reasoning. The introduction of AlphaGeometry, a\nneuro-symbolic model trained with 100 million synthetic samples, marked a major\nbreakthrough. It solved 25 of 30 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)\nproblems whereas the reported baseline based on Wu's method solved only ten. In\nthis note, we revisit the IMO-AG-30 Challenge introduced with AlphaGeometry,\nand find that Wu's method is surprisingly strong. Wu's method alone can solve\n15 problems, and some of them are not solved by any of the other methods. This\nleads to two key findings: (i) Combining Wu's method with the classic synthetic\nmethods of deductive databases and angle, ratio, and distance chasing solves 21\nout of 30 methods by just using a CPU-only laptop with a time limit of 5\nminutes per problem. Essentially, this classic method solves just 4 problems\nless than AlphaGeometry and establishes the first fully symbolic baseline\nstrong enough to rival the performance of an IMO silver medalist. (ii) Wu's\nmethod even solves 2 of the 5 problems that AlphaGeometry failed to solve.\nThus, by combining AlphaGeometry with Wu's method we set a new state-of-the-art\nfor automated theorem proving on IMO-AG-30, solving 27 out of 30 problems, the\nfirst AI method which outperforms an IMO gold medalist.\n","authors":["Shiven Sinha","Ameya Prabhu","Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","Siddharth Bhat","Matthias Bethge"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06405v2.pdf","comment":"Work in Progress.

Psycholinguistic,\nmorphological and lexical proxies are often used. Human ratings are also used.\nThe problem here is that these proxies do not measure complexity directly, and\nhuman ratings are subject to subjective bias. In this study we contend that\nsome form of 'latent complexity' can be approximated by using samples of simple\nand complex words. We use a sample of 'simple' words from primary school\npicture books and a sample of 'complex' words from high school and academic\nsettings. In order to analyse the differences between these classes, we look at\nthe letter positional probabilities (LPPs). We find a strong statistical\nassociation between simple and complex words on the basis of LPPs. For example,\nsimple words are significantly (p<.001) more likely to start with w, b, s, h,\ng,k, j,t y or f, while complex words are significantly (p<.001) more likely to\nstart with i, a, e, r, v, u or d. We find similar strong associations for\nsubsequent letter positions, with 84 letter-position variables in the first 6\npositions being significant at the p<.001 level. We then use LPPs as variables\nin creating a classifier which can classify the two classes with an 83%\naccuracy. We test these findings using a second data set, with 66 LPPs\nsignificant (p<.001) in the first 6 positions common to both datasets.

Studies of bias in LM\nresponses to open-ended prompts (where identity classifications are left\nunspecified) are lacking and have not yet been grounded in end-consumer harms.\nHere, we advance studies of generative LM bias by considering a broader set of\nnatural use cases via open-ended prompting. In this \"laissez-faire\" setting, we\nfind that synthetically generated texts from five of the most pervasive LMs\n(ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, Claude2.0, Llama2, and PaLM2) perpetuate harms of\nomission, subordination, and stereotyping for minoritized individuals with\nintersectional race, gender, and/or sexual orientation identities (AI/AN,\nAsian, Black, Latine, MENA, NH/PI, Female, Non-binary, Queer).

Multiple studies have\nexamined the privacy risks linked to ICL and prompting in general, and have\ndevised techniques to alleviate these risks. Thus, there is a necessity to\norganize these mitigation techniques for the benefit of the community. This\nsurvey provides a systematic overview of the privacy protection methods\nemployed during ICL and prompting in general. We review, analyze, and compare\ndifferent methods under this paradigm. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the\nresources accessible for the development of these frameworks.

Due to the\nscarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained\ntransformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are\nstill limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high\ncomputation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D\nmodels, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce\nAny2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models\n(vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from\nany source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection\nstrategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions\nwithin the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token\nwith a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D\ngeometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the\ntransformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each\ntransformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial\nknowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D\ntokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers.

Combined with collision-avoiding motion\nprimitives and a two-stage reinforcement learning approach, our motion\nsynthesis model offers a closed-loop solution where the embodied perception and\nmovement of the virtual human are seamlessly coupled. Compared to previous\nworks, our model eliminates the need for a pre-defined global path, and is\ndirectly applicable to dynamic environments. Combined with our easy-to-use and\nscalable data generation pipeline, we demonstrate EgoGen's efficacy in three\ntasks: mapping and localization for head-mounted cameras, egocentric camera\ntracking, and human mesh recovery from egocentric views. EgoGen will be fully\nopen-sourced, offering a practical solution for creating realistic egocentric\ntraining data and aiming to serve as a useful tool for egocentric computer\nvision research.

Currently, brain decoding is confined to a\nper-subject-per-model paradigm, limiting its applicability to the same\nindividual for whom the decoding model is trained. This constraint stems from\nthree key challenges: 1) the inherent variability in input dimensions across\nsubjects due to differences in brain size; 2) the unique intrinsic neural\npatterns, influencing how different individuals perceive and process sensory\ninformation; 3) limited data availability for new subjects in real-world\nscenarios hampers the performance of decoding models. In this paper, we present\na novel approach, MindBridge, that achieves cross-subject brain decoding by\nemploying only one model. Our proposed framework establishes a generic paradigm\ncapable of addressing these challenges by introducing biological-inspired\naggregation function and novel cyclic fMRI reconstruction mechanism for\nsubject-invariant representation learning. Notably, by cycle reconstruction of\nfMRI, MindBridge can enable novel fMRI synthesis, which also can serve as\npseudo data augmentation. Within the framework, we also devise a novel\nreset-tuning method for adapting a pretrained model to a new subject.\nExperimental results demonstrate MindBridge's ability to reconstruct images for\nmultiple subjects, which is competitive with dedicated subject-specific models.\nFurthermore, with limited data for a new subject, we achieve a high level of\ndecoding accuracy, surpassing that of subject-specific models.

In this paper, we\npresent a transformer-based blind-spot network (TBSN) by analyzing and\nredesigning the transformer operators that meet the blind-spot requirement.\nSpecifically, TBSN follows the architectural principles of dilated BSNs, and\nincorporates spatial as well as channel self-attention layers to enhance the\nnetwork capability. For spatial self-attention, an elaborate mask is applied to\nthe attention matrix to restrict its receptive field, thus mimicking the\ndilated convolution.

In detail, first of all, a self-supervised map-centric\nlandmark definition strategy is adopted, making places in either indoor or\noutdoor scenes act as unique landmarks. Then, sparse keypoints extracted from\nimages, are utilized as the input to a transformer-based deep neural network\nfor landmark recognition; these keypoints enable PRAM to recognize hundreds of\nlandmarks with high time and memory efficiency. Keypoints along with recognized\nlandmark labels are further used for registration between query images and the\n3D landmark map. Different from previous hierarchical methods, PRAM discards\nglobal and local descriptors, and reduces over 90% storage. Since PRAM utilizes\nrecognition and landmark-wise verification to replace global reference search\nand exhaustive matching respectively, it runs 2.4 times faster than prior\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, PRAM opens new directions for visual\nlocalization including multi-modality localization, map-centric feature\nlearning, and hierarchical scene coordinate regression.\n","authors":["Fei Xue","Ignas Budvytis","Roberto Cipolla"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07785v1.pdf","comment":"project page: https://feixue94.github.io/pram-project/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04562v2","updated":"2024-04-11T14:28:00Z","published":"2024-04-06T09:03:18Z","title":"Diffusion Time-step Curriculum for One Image to 3D Generation","summary":"  Score distillation sampling~(SDS) has been widely adopted to overcome the\nabsence of unseen views in reconstructing 3D objects from a \\textbf{single}\nimage.

However,\nexisting ZSL methods simply extract visual features using a pre-trained network\nbackbone (i.e., CNN or ViT), which fail to learn matched visual-semantic\ncorrespondences for representing semantic-related visual features as lacking of\nthe guidance of semantic information, resulting in undesirable visual-semantic\ninteractions. To tackle this issue, we propose a progressive semantic-guided\nvision transformer for zero-shot learning (dubbed ZSLViT). ZSLViT mainly\nconsiders two properties in the whole network: i) discover the semantic-related\nvisual representations explicitly, and ii) discard the semantic-unrelated\nvisual information. Specifically, we first introduce semantic-embedded token\nlearning to improve the visual-semantic correspondences via semantic\nenhancement and discover the semantic-related visual tokens explicitly with\nsemantic-guided token attention. Then, we fuse low semantic-visual\ncorrespondence visual tokens to discard the semantic-unrelated visual\ninformation for visual enhancement. These two operations are integrated into\nvarious encoders to progressively learn semantic-related visual representations\nfor accurate visual-semantic interactions in ZSL. The extensive experiments\nshow that our ZSLViT achieves significant performance gains on three popular\nbenchmark datasets, i.e., CUB, SUN, and AWA2.\n","authors":["Shiming Chen","Wenjin Hou","Salman Khan","Fahad Shahbaz Khan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07713v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted to CVPR'24"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07711v1","updated":"2024-04-11T12:58:12Z","published":"2024-04-11T12:58:12Z","title":"OpenTrench3D: A Photogrammetric 3D Point Cloud Dataset for Semantic\n  Segmentation of Underground Utilities","summary":"  Identifying and classifying underground utilities is an important task for\nefficient and effective urban planning and infrastructure maintenance.

Especially when\nworking with cultural heritage collections that contain myriad uncertainties,\nannotating data, or re-annotating, legacy data is an arduous task. In this\npaper, we describe working with two pre-annotated sets of medieval manuscript\nimages that exhibit conflicting and overlapping metadata.

However, concerns regarding adverse\nhealth effects from contrast agents used in CTPA have constrained its clinical\nutility. In contrast, identifying arteries and veins using non-contrast CT, a\nconventional and low-cost clinical examination routine, has long been\nconsidered impossible. Here we propose a High-abundant Pulmonary Artery-vein\nSegmentation (HiPaS) framework achieving accurate artery-vein segmentation on\nboth non-contrast CT and CTPA across various spatial resolutions. HiPaS first\nperforms spatial normalization on raw CT scans via a super-resolution module,\nand then iteratively achieves segmentation results at different branch levels\nby utilizing the low-level vessel segmentation as a prior for high-level vessel\nsegmentation. We trained and validated HiPaS on our established multi-centric\ndataset comprising 1,073 CT volumes with meticulous manual annotation. Both\nquantitative experiments and clinical evaluation demonstrated the superior\nperformance of HiPaS, achieving a dice score of 91.8% and a sensitivity of\n98.0%. Further experiments demonstrated the non-inferiority of HiPaS\nsegmentation on non-contrast CT compared to segmentation on CTPA. Employing\nHiPaS, we have conducted an anatomical study of pulmonary vasculature on 10,613\nparticipants in China (five sites), discovering a new association between\npulmonary vessel abundance and sex and age: vessel abundance is significantly\nhigher in females than in males, and slightly decreases with age, under the\ncontrolling of lung volumes (p < 0.0001).

While plain Transformers\nhave been attempted for this task, they still fall short compared to the\ncurrent leading methods, which are rooted in Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCNs) due to the absence of structural priors. Recently, a novel selective\nstate space model, Mamba, has surfaced as a compelling alternative to the\nattention mechanism in Transformers, offering efficient modeling of long\nsequences. In this work, to the utmost extent of our awareness, we present the\nfirst SAR framework incorporating Mamba. Each fundamental block of our model\nadopts a novel U-ShiftGCN architecture with Mamba as its core component. The\nencoder segment of the U-ShiftGCN is devised to extract spatial features from\nthe skeletal data using downsampling vanilla Shift S-GCN blocks. These spatial\nfeatures then undergo intermediate temporal modeling facilitated by the Mamba\nblock before progressing to the encoder section, which comprises vanilla\nupsampling Shift S-GCN blocks. Additionally, a Shift T-GCN (ShiftTCN) temporal\nmodeling unit is employed before the exit of each fundamental block to refine\ntemporal representations. This particular integration of downsampling spatial,\nintermediate temporal, upsampling spatial, and ultimate temporal subunits\nyields promising results for skeleton action recognition. We dub the resulting\nmodel \\textbf{Simba}, which attains state-of-the-art performance across three\nwell-known benchmark skeleton action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D\n120, and Northwestern-UCLA. Interestingly, U-ShiftGCN (Simba without\nIntermediate Mamba Block) by itself is capable of performing reasonably well\nand surpasses our baseline.\n","authors":["Soumyabrata Chaudhuri","Saumik Bhattacharya"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07645v1.pdf","comment":"20 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03425v2","updated":"2024-04-11T10:51:34Z","published":"2024-04-04T13:06:25Z","title":"ChangeMamba: Remote Sensing Change Detection with Spatio-Temporal State\n  Space Model","summary":"  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have made impressive\nprogress in the field of remote sensing change detection (CD). However, both\narchitectures have inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture,\nbased on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of\nnatural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the\nshortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the\nfirst time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks.\nWe tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and\nMambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD),\nand building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt\nthe cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full\nlearning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For\nthe change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose\nthree spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally\ncombined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve\nspatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining\naccurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed\nframeworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without\nusing any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the\npotential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks.

Since person images are highly structured, existing approaches\nrequire dense connections for complex deformations and occlusions because these\nare generally handled through multi-level warping and masking in latent space.\nThe feature maps generated by convolutional neural networks do not have\nequivariance, and hence multi-level warping is required to perform pose\nalignment. Inspired by the ability of the diffusion model to generate\nphotorealistic images from the given conditional guidance, we propose recurrent\npose alignment to provide pose-aligned texture features as conditional\nguidance. Due to the leakage of the source pose in conditional guidance, we\npropose gradient guidance from pose interaction fields, which output the\ndistance from the valid pose manifold given a predicted pose as input.

Our work is motivated by the observations that road lines and markings\nare (1) frequently occluded in the presence of moving vehicles, shadow, and\nglare and (2) highly structured with low intra-class shape variance and overall\nhigh appearance consistency. To solve these issues, we propose a Homography\nGuided Fusion (HomoFusion) module to exploit temporally-adjacent video frames\nfor complementary cues facilitating the correct classification of the partially\noccluded road lines or markings.

In the\nsynthesis process, inspired that existing 3D GAN models can unconditionally\nsynthesize high-fidelity multi-view images, we seek to adopt off-the-shelf 3D\nGAN models, such as EG3D, as a free source to provide geometry priors through\nsynthesizing multi-view data. Simultaneously, to further improve the geometry\nquality of the synthetic data, we introduce a truncation method to effectively\nsample latent codes within 3D GAN models. To tackle the absence of multi-view\nsupervision for single-view images, we design the depth-aware training\napproach, incorporating a depth-aware discriminator to guide geometry priors\nthrough depth maps.

Understanding how\ngenerative models copy \"artistic style\" is more complex than duplicating a\nsingle image, as style is comprised by a set of elements (or signature) that\nfrequently co-occurs across a body of work, where each individual work may vary\nsignificantly. In our paper, we first reformulate the problem of \"artistic\ncopyright infringement\" to a classification problem over image sets, instead of\nprobing image-wise similarities. We then introduce ArtSavant, a practical\n(i.e., efficient and easy to understand) tool to (i) determine the unique style\nof an artist by comparing it to a reference dataset of works from 372 artists\ncurated from WikiArt, and (ii) recognize if the identified style reappears in\ngenerated images. We leverage two complementary methods to perform artistic\nstyle classification over image sets, includingTagMatch, which is a novel\ninherently interpretable and attributable method, making it more suitable for\nbroader use by non-technical stake holders (artists, lawyers, judges, etc).\nLeveraging ArtSavant, we then perform a large-scale empirical study to provide\nquantitative insight on the prevalence of artistic style copying across 3\npopular text-to-image generative models.

Conventional attack methods employ perturbations at a\nsingle granularity, e.g., word or sentence level, to target documents. However,\nlimiting perturbations to a single level of granularity may reduce the\nflexibility of adversarial examples, thereby diminishing the potential threat\nof the attack. Therefore, we focus on generating high-quality adversarial\nexamples by incorporating multi-granular perturbations. Achieving this\nobjective involves tackling a combinatorial explosion problem, which requires\nidentifying an optimal combination of perturbations across all possible levels\nof granularity, positions, and textual pieces. To address this challenge, we\ntransform the multi-granular adversarial attack into a sequential\ndecision-making process, where perturbations in the next attack step build on\nthe perturbed document in the current attack step. Since the attack process can\nonly access the final state without direct intermediate signals, we use\nreinforcement learning to perform multi-granular attacks.

In this paper, we introduce\nAny2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models\n(vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from\nany source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection\nstrategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions\nwithin the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token\nwith a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D\ngeometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the\ntransformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each\ntransformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial\nknowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D\ntokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We\nconduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of\nour method.

In this\npaper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges in\ngenerating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end,\nwe propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generation\nby explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images\nand conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we\nuse a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the corresponding\ncondition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency loss\nbetween the input conditional control and extracted condition. A\nstraightforward implementation would be generating images from random noises\nand then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requires\nstoring gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable time\nand memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategy\nthat deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses the\nsingle-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensive\ncosts associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantly\nimproves controllability under various conditional controls.

To illustrate this mechanism, we study the simple setting of vanilla\ngradient descent on a polynomial regression problem with a two layer neural\nnetwork which exhibits grokking without regularization in a way that cannot be\nexplained by existing theories. We identify sufficient statistics for the test\nloss of such a network, and tracking these over training reveals that grokking\narises in this setting when the network first attempts to fit a kernel\nregression solution with its initial features, followed by late-time feature\nlearning where a generalizing solution is identified after train loss is\nalready low. We find that the key determinants of grokking are the rate of\nfeature learning -- which can be controlled precisely by parameters that scale\nthe network output -- and the alignment of the initial features with the target\nfunction $y(x)$. We argue this delayed generalization arises when (1) the top\neigenvectors of the initial neural tangent kernel and the task labels $y(x)$\nare misaligned, but (2) the dataset size is large enough so that it is possible\nfor the network to generalize eventually, but not so large that train loss\nperfectly tracks test loss at all epochs, and (3) the network begins training\nin the lazy regime so does not learn features immediately. We conclude with\nevidence that this transition from lazy (linear model) to rich training\n(feature learning) can control grokking in more general settings, like on\nMNIST, one-layer Transformers, and student-teacher networks.\n","authors":["Tanishq Kumar","Blake Bordelon","Samuel J.

To discourage overfitting, researchers have\ndeveloped multicomponent loss functions that reduce intra-class feature\ncorrelation and maximize inter-class feature distance in one or more layers of\nthe network. By analyzing the penultimate feature layer activations output by a\nDNN's feature extraction section prior to the linear classifier, we find that\nmodified forms of the intra-class feature covariance and inter-class prototype\nseparation are key components of a fundamental Chebyshev upper bound on the\nprobability of misclassification, which we designate the Chebyshev Prototype\nRisk (CPR).

However,\nexisting ZSL methods simply extract visual features using a pre-trained network\nbackbone (i.e., CNN or ViT), which fail to learn matched visual-semantic\ncorrespondences for representing semantic-related visual features as lacking of\nthe guidance of semantic information, resulting in undesirable visual-semantic\ninteractions. To tackle this issue, we propose a progressive semantic-guided\nvision transformer for zero-shot learning (dubbed ZSLViT).

Specifically, we first introduce semantic-embedded token\nlearning to improve the visual-semantic correspondences via semantic\nenhancement and discover the semantic-related visual tokens explicitly with\nsemantic-guided token attention.

However, automatic ontology matchers are often bound to the heuristics\nthey are based on, leaving many matches unidentified. Interactive ontology\nmatching systems involving human experts have been introduced, but they do not\nsolve the fundamental issue of flexibly finding additional matches outside the\nscope of the implemented heuristics, even though this is highly demanded in\nindustrial settings. Active machine learning methods appear to be a promising\npath towards a flexible interactive ontology matcher. However, off-the-shelf\nactive learning mechanisms suffer from low query efficiency due to extreme\nclass imbalance, resulting in a last-mile problem where high human effort is\nrequired to identify the remaining matches.\n  To address the last-mile problem, this work introduces DualLoop, an active\nlearning method tailored to ontology matching. DualLoop offers three main\ncontributions: (1) an ensemble of tunable heuristic matchers, (2) a short-term\nlearner with a novel query strategy adapted to highly imbalanced data, and (3)\nlong-term learners to explore potential matches by creating and tuning new\nheuristics. We evaluated DualLoop on three datasets of varying sizes and\ndomains.

Due to the coupling between\nrouting and purchasing, existing works on TPPs commonly address route\nconstruction and purchase planning simultaneously, which, however, leads to\nexact methods with high computational cost and heuristics with sophisticated\ndesign but limited performance. In sharp contrast, we propose a novel approach\nbased on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which addresses route construction\nand purchase planning separately, while evaluating and optimizing the solution\nfrom a global perspective. The key components of our approach include a\nbipartite graph representation for TPPs to capture the market-product\nrelations, and a policy network that extracts information from the bipartite\ngraph and uses it to sequentially construct the route. One significant benefit\nof our framework is that we can efficiently construct the route using the\npolicy network, and once the route is determined, the associated purchasing\nplan can be easily derived through linear programming, while, leveraging DRL,\nwe can train the policy network to optimize the global solution objective.\nFurthermore, by introducing a meta-learning strategy, the policy network can be\ntrained stably on large-sized TPP instances, and generalize well across\ninstances of varying sizes and distributions, even to much larger instances\nthat are never seen during training. Experiments on various synthetic TPP\ninstances and the TPPLIB benchmark demonstrate that our DRL-based approach can\nsignificantly outperform well-established TPP heuristics, reducing the\noptimality gap by 40%-90%, and also showing an advantage in runtime, especially\non large-sized instances.\n","authors":["Haofeng Yuan","Rongping Zhu","Wanlu Yang","Shiji Song","Keyou You","Yuli Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02476v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10839v2","updated":"2024-04-11T05:46:09Z","published":"2022-07-22T02:06:53Z","title":"Robust Knowledge Adaptation for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks","summary":"  Graph structured data often possess dynamic characters in nature. Recent\nyears have witnessed the increasing attentions paid to dynamic graph neural\nnetworks for modelling graph data. However, almost all existing approaches\noperate under the assumption that, upon the establishment of a new link, the\nembeddings of the neighboring nodes should undergo updates to learn temporal\ndynamics. Nevertheless, these approaches face the following limitation: If the\nnode introduced by a new connection contains noisy information, propagating its\nknowledge to other nodes becomes unreliable and may even lead to the collapse\nof the model. In this paper, we propose Ada-DyGNN: a robust knowledge\nAdaptation framework via reinforcement learning for Dynamic Graph Neural\nNetworks. In contrast to previous approaches, which update the embeddings of\nthe neighbor nodes immediately after adding a new link, Ada-DyGNN adaptively\ndetermines which nodes should be updated. Considering that the decision to\nupdate the embedding of one neighbor node can significantly impact other\nneighbor nodes, we conceptualize the node update selection as a sequence\ndecision problem and employ reinforcement learning to address it effectively.\nBy this means, we can adaptively propagate knowledge to other nodes for\nlearning robust node embedding representations. To the best of our knowledge,\nour approach constitutes the first attempt to explore robust knowledge\nadaptation via reinforcement learning specifically tailored for dynamic graph\nneural networks.

This approach has simultaneously unlocked incredible\nachievements in science and technology, and hindered AI from overcoming\nlong-standing limitations with respect to explainability, ethical harms, and\nenvironmental efficiency. Drawing on qualitative interviews and computational\nanalyses, our three-part history of AI research traces the creation of this\n\"epistemic monoculture\" back to a radical reconceptualization of scientific\nprogress that began in the late 1980s. In the first era of AI research\n(1950s-late 1980s), researchers and patrons approached AI as a \"basic\" science\nthat would advance through autonomous exploration and organic assessments of\nprogress (e.g., peer-review, theoretical consensus). The failure of this\napproach led to a retrenchment of funding in the 1980s. Amid this \"AI Winter,\"\nan intervention by the U.S. government reoriented the field towards measurable\nprogress on tasks of military and commercial interest. A new evaluation system\ncalled \"benchmarking\" provided an objective way to quantify progress on tasks\nby focusing exclusively on increasing predictive accuracy on example datasets.\nDistilling science down to verifiable metrics clarified the roles of\nscientists, allowed the field to rapidly integrate talent, and provided clear\nsignals of significance and progress. But history has also revealed a tradeoff\nto this streamlined approach to science: the consolidation around external\ninterests and inherent conservatism of benchmarking has disincentivized\nexploration beyond scaling monoculture. In the discussion, we explain how AI's\nmonoculture offers a compelling challenge to the belief that basic,\nexploration-driven research is needed for scientific progress. Implications for\nthe spread of AI monoculture to other sciences in the era of generative AI are\nalso discussed.\n","authors":["Bernard J.

Conventional attack methods employ perturbations at a\nsingle granularity, e.g., word or sentence level, to target documents. However,\nlimiting perturbations to a single level of granularity may reduce the\nflexibility of adversarial examples, thereby diminishing the potential threat\nof the attack. Therefore, we focus on generating high-quality adversarial\nexamples by incorporating multi-granular perturbations. Achieving this\nobjective involves tackling a combinatorial explosion problem, which requires\nidentifying an optimal combination of perturbations across all possible levels\nof granularity, positions, and textual pieces. To address this challenge, we\ntransform the multi-granular adversarial attack into a sequential\ndecision-making process, where perturbations in the next attack step build on\nthe perturbed document in the current attack step. Since the attack process can\nonly access the final state without direct intermediate signals, we use\nreinforcement learning to perform multi-granular attacks. During the\nreinforcement learning process, two agents work cooperatively to identify\nmulti-granular vulnerabilities as attack targets and organize perturbation\ncandidates into a final perturbation sequence.

LMMs typically use a\nfixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the\nCLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more\ncomplex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which\nincrease the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design\nof the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these\nmodels tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To\ntackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar\nto prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this,\nwe propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which\nlargely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model\nperformance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their\nsimilarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned\ntokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned\ntokens to supplement their information.

In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good\nas any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function\napproximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate\nthat on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH)\ndataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the\nmetric of GPT4 win-rate.

As the need for longer context grows, a significant bottleneck\nin model deployment emerges due to the linear expansion of the Key-Value (KV)\ncache with the context length. Existing methods primarily rely on various\nhypotheses, such as sorting the KV cache based on attention scores for\nreplacement or eviction, to compress the KV cache and improve model throughput.\nHowever, heuristics used by these strategies may wrongly evict essential KV\ncache, which can significantly degrade model performance. In this paper, we\npropose QAQ, a Quality Adaptive Quantization scheme for the KV cache. We\ntheoretically demonstrate that key cache and value cache exhibit distinct\nsensitivities to quantization, leading to the formulation of separate\nquantization strategies for their non-uniform quantization. Through the\nintegration of dedicated outlier handling, as well as an improved\nattention-aware approach, QAQ achieves up to 10x the compression ratio of the\nKV cache size with a neglectable impact on model performance.

In this paper, we investigate\ntokenization from a theoretical point of view by studying the behavior of\ntransformers on simple data generating processes. When trained on data drawn\nfrom certain simple $k^{\\text{th}}$-order Markov processes for $k > 1$,\ntransformers exhibit a surprising phenomenon - in the absence of tokenization,\nthey empirically fail to learn the right distribution and predict characters\naccording to a unigram model (Makkuva et al., 2024). With the addition of\ntokenization, however, we empirically observe that transformers break through\nthis barrier and are able to model the probabilities of sequences drawn from\nthe source near-optimally, achieving small cross-entropy loss. With this\nobservation as starting point, we study the end-to-end cross-entropy loss\nachieved by transformers with and without tokenization. With the appropriate\ntokenization, we show that even the simplest unigram models (over tokens)\nlearnt by transformers are able to model the probability of sequences drawn\nfrom $k^{\\text{th}}$-order Markov sources near optimally.

Whereas,\nempirical studies reveal that advanced detectors generally assign lower scores\nto those novel instances, which are inadvertently suppressed during inference\nby commonly adopted greedy strategies like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS),\nleading to sub-optimal detection performance for novel classes. This paper\nsystematically investigates this problem with the commonly-adopted two-stage\nOVOD paradigm. Specifically, in the region-proposal stage, proposals that\ncontain novel instances showcase lower objectness scores, since they are\ntreated as background proposals during the training phase. Meanwhile, in the\nobject-classification stage, novel objects share lower region-text similarities\n(i.e., classification scores) due to the biased visual-language alignment by\nseen training samples. To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces two\nadvanced measures to adjust confidence scores and conserve erroneously\ndismissed objects: (1) a class-agnostic localization quality estimate via\noverlap degree of region/object proposals, and (2) a text-guided visual\nsimilarity estimate with proxy prototypes for novel classes. Integrated with\nadjusting techniques specifically designed for the region-proposal and\nobject-classification stages, this paper derives the aggregated confidence\nestimate for the open-vocabulary object detection paradigm (AggDet).

Our approach mainly contains two\ntypes of data augmentation, which we call Simulated Physical Spoofing Clues\naugmentation (SPSC) and Simulated Digital Spoofing Clues augmentation (SDSC).\nSPSC and SDSC augment live samples into simulated attack samples by simulating\nspoofing clues of physical and digital attacks, respectively, which\nsignificantly improve the capability of the model to detect \"unseen\" attack\ntypes. Extensive experiments show that SPSC and SDSC can achieve\nstate-of-the-art generalization in Protocols 2.1 and 2.2 of the UniAttackData\ndataset, respectively. Our method won first place in \"Unified Physical-Digital\nFace Attack Detection\" of the 5th Face Anti-spoofing Challenge@CVPR2024.

To address this challenge, the core\nidea is to balance the optimization of each modality to achieve a joint\noptimum. Existing approaches often employ a modal-level control mechanism for\nadjusting the update of each modal parameter. However, such a global-wise\nupdating mechanism ignores the different importance of each parameter. Inspired\nby subnetwork optimization, we explore a uniform sampling-based optimization\nstrategy and find it more effective than global-wise updating. According to the\nfindings, we further propose a novel importance sampling-based, element-wise\njoint optimization method, called Adaptively Mask Subnetworks Considering Modal\nSignificance(AMSS). Specifically, we incorporate mutual information rates to\ndetermine the modal significance and employ non-uniform adaptive sampling to\nselect foreground subnetworks from each modality for parameter updates, thereby\nrebalancing multi-modal learning. Additionally, we demonstrate the reliability\nof the AMSS strategy through convergence analysis. Building upon theoretical\ninsights, we further enhance the multi-modal mask subnetwork strategy using\nunbiased estimation, referred to as AMSS+.

In this work, we provide counterfactual\nexplanations for face forgery detection from an artifact removal perspective.\nSpecifically, we first invert the forgery images into the StyleGAN latent\nspace, and then adversarially optimize their latent representations with the\ndiscrimination supervision from the target detection model. We verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed explanations from two aspects: (1) Counterfactual\nTrace Visualization: the enhanced forgery images are useful to reveal artifacts\nby visually contrasting the original images and two different visualization\nmethods; (2) Transferable Adversarial Attacks: the adversarial forgery images\ngenerated by attacking the detection model are able to mislead other detection\nmodels, implying the removed artifacts are general.

Based on CDec, we introduce a Language\nReconstruction Module and a reconstruction loss. This module leverages queries\nfrom the final layer of the decoder to reconstruct the input language and\ncompute the reconstruction loss.

Weight and token\npruning are two well-known methods for reducing complexity: weight pruning\nreduces the model size and associated computational demands, while token\npruning further dynamically reduces the computation based on the input.\nCombining these two techniques should significantly reduce computation\ncomplexity and model size; however, naively integrating them results in\nirregular computation patterns, leading to significant accuracy drops and\ndifficulties in hardware acceleration.\n  Addressing the above challenges, we propose a comprehensive\nalgorithm-hardware codesign for accelerating ViT on FPGA through simultaneous\npruning -combining static weight pruning and dynamic token pruning. For\nalgorithm design, we systematically combine a hardware-aware structured\nblock-pruning method for pruning model parameters and a dynamic token pruning\nmethod for removing unimportant token vectors. Moreover, we design a novel\ntraining algorithm to recover the model's accuracy. For hardware design, we\ndevelop a novel hardware accelerator for executing the pruned model. The\nproposed hardware design employs multi-level parallelism with load balancing\nstrategy to efficiently deal with the irregular computation pattern led by the\ntwo pruning approaches.

However, due to\nthe ambiguous contexts and fuzzy regions, the performance of WSSS, especially\nthe stages of generating Class Activation Maps (CAMs) and refining pseudo\nmasks, widely suffers from ambiguity while being barely noticed by previous\nliterature. In this work, we propose UniA, a unified single-staged WSSS\nframework, to efficiently tackle this issue from the perspective of uncertainty\ninference and affinity diversification, respectively. When activating class\nobjects, we argue that the false activation stems from the bias to the\nambiguous regions during the feature extraction. Therefore, we design a more\nrobust feature representation with a probabilistic Gaussian distribution and\nintroduce the uncertainty estimation to avoid the bias. A distribution loss is\nparticularly proposed to supervise the process, which effectively captures the\nambiguity and models the complex dependencies among features. When refining\npseudo labels, we observe that the affinity from the prevailing refinement\nmethods intends to be similar among ambiguities. To this end, an affinity\ndiversification module is proposed to promote diversity among semantics. A\nmutual complementing refinement is proposed to initially rectify the ambiguous\naffinity with multiple inferred pseudo labels. More importantly, a contrastive\naffinity loss is further designed to diversify the relations among unrelated\nsemantics, which reliably propagates the diversity into the whole feature\nrepresentations and helps generate better pseudo masks.

Multi-domain learning is a typical solution in this regard.\nWhile considerable efforts have been made in this regard, there are still two\nlong-standing challenges: (1) Accurately depicting the differences among\ndomains using domain features is crucial for enhancing the performance of each\ndomain. However, manually designing domain features and models for numerous\ndomains can be a laborious task. (2) Users typically have limited impressions\nin only a few domains. Extracting features automatically from other domains and\nleveraging them to improve the predictive capabilities of each domain has\nconsistently posed a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an\nAutomatic Domain Feature Extraction and Personalized Integration (DFEI)\nframework for the large-scale multi-domain recommendation. The framework\nautomatically transforms the behavior of each individual user into an\naggregation of all user behaviors within the domain, which serves as the domain\nfeatures. Unlike offline feature engineering methods, the extracted domain\nfeatures are higher-order representations and directly related to the target\nlabel. Besides, by personalized integration of domain features from other\ndomains for each user and the innovation in the training mode, the DFEI\nframework can yield more accurate conversion identification.

However, we\nhave yet to understand how to best use a large number of evaluations as using\nthem for random variations alone is not always effective. High-dimensional\nsearch spaces are a typical situation where random variations struggle to\neffectively search. Another situation is uncertain settings where solutions can\nappear better than they truly are and naively evaluating more solutions might\nmislead QD algorithms. In this work, we propose MAP-Elites-Multi-ES (MEMES), a\nnovel QD algorithm based on Evolution Strategies (ES) designed to exploit fast\nparallel evaluations more effectively. MEMES maintains multiple (up to 100)\nsimultaneous ES processes, each with its own independent objective and reset\nmechanism designed for QD optimisation, all on just a single GPU. We show that\nMEMES outperforms both gradient-based and mutation-based QD algorithms on\nblack-box optimisation and QD-Reinforcement-Learning tasks, demonstrating its\nbenefit across domains. Additionally, our approach outperforms sampling-based\nQD methods in uncertain domains when given the same evaluation budget.

To address this challenge, the core\nidea is to balance the optimization of each modality to achieve a joint\noptimum. Existing approaches often employ a modal-level control mechanism for\nadjusting the update of each modal parameter.

The\nchallenge lies in the domain gap between low-quality images observed by the\nmoving robot, characterized by motion blur and low-resolution, and high-quality\nquery images provided by the user. Such domain gaps could significantly reduce\nthe task success rate but have not been the focus of previous work. To address\nthis, we propose a novel method called Few-shot Cross-quality Instance-aware\nAdaptation (CrossIA), which employs contrastive learning with an instance\nclassifier to align features between massive low- and few high-quality images.\nThis approach effectively reduces the domain gap by bringing the latent\nrepresentations of cross-quality images closer on an instance basis.\nAdditionally, the system integrates an object image collection with a\npre-trained deblurring model to enhance the observed image quality. Our method\nfine-tunes the SimSiam model, pre-trained on ImageNet, using CrossIA. We\nevaluated our method's effectiveness through an InstanceImageNav task with 20\ndifferent types of instances, where the robot identifies the same instance in a\nreal-world environment as a high-quality query image. Our experiments showed\nthat our method improves the task success rate by up to three times compared to\nthe baseline, a conventional approach based on SuperGlue.

MMCode contains 3,548\nquestions and 6,620 images collected from real-world programming challenges\nharvested from 10 code competition websites, presenting significant challenges\ndue to the extreme demand for reasoning abilities. Our experiment results show\nthat current state-of-the-art models struggle to solve these problems. The\nresults highlight the lack of powerful vision-code models, and we hope MMCode\ncan serve as an inspiration for future works in this domain.

Cascading offers a simple strategy to achieve more favorable\ncost-quality tradeoffs: here, a small model is invoked for most \"easy\"\ninstances, while a few \"hard\" instances are deferred to the large model. While\nthe principles underpinning cascading are well-studied for classification tasks\n- with deferral based on predicted class uncertainty favored theoretically and\npractically - a similar understanding is lacking for generative LM tasks. In\nthis work, we initiate a systematic study of deferral rules for LM cascades. We\nbegin by examining the natural extension of predicted class uncertainty to\ngenerative LM tasks, namely, the predicted sequence uncertainty. We show that\nthis measure suffers from the length bias problem, either over- or\nunder-emphasizing outputs based on their lengths. This is because LMs produce a\nsequence of uncertainty values, one for each output token; and moreover, the\nnumber of output tokens is variable across examples. To mitigate this issue, we\npropose to exploit the richer token-level uncertainty information implicit in\ngenerative LMs. We argue that naive predicted sequence uncertainty corresponds\nto a simple aggregation of these uncertainties. By contrast, we show that\nincorporating token-level uncertainty through learned post-hoc deferral rules\ncan significantly outperform such simple aggregation strategies, via\nexperiments on a range of natural language benchmarks with FLAN-T5 models.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for the\nprediction, which receives the images supported by information on the mix\ndesign as input. In addition, the network receives temporal information in the\nform of the time difference between the time at which the images are taken and\nthe time at which the reference values of the concretes are carried out. With\nthis temporal information, the network implicitly learns the time-dependent\nbehaviour of the concretes properties. The network predicts the slump flow\ndiameter, the yield stress and the plastic viscosity. The time-dependent\nprediction potentially opens up the pathway to determine the temporal\ndevelopment of the fresh concrete properties already during mixing. This\nprovides a huge advantage for the concrete industry. As a result,\ncountermeasures can be taken in a timely manner.

However, the\nunification across a large number of tasks is non-trivial due to various data\nformats and training pipelines. To this end, ICT introduces two designs.\nFirstly, it standardizes input-output data of different tasks into RGB image\npairs, e.g., semantic segmentation data pairs an RGB image with its\nsegmentation mask in the same RGB format. This turns different tasks into a\ngeneral translation task between two RGB images.

This task is\nspecifically challenging when images from the new domain are collected without\nground-truth depth measurements, and possibly with sensors of different\nintrinsics. To overcome such limitations, a recent zero-shot solution was\ntrained on an extensive training dataset and encoded the various camera\nintrinsics. Other solutions generated synthetic data with depth labels that\nmatched the intrinsics of the new target data to enable depth-scale transfer\nbetween the domains.\n  In this work we present an alternative solution that can utilize any existing\nsynthetic or real dataset, that has a small number of images annotated with\nground truth depth labels. Specifically, we show that self-supervised depth\nestimators result in up-to-scale predictions that are linearly correlated to\ntheir absolute depth values across the domain, a property that we model in this\nwork using a single scalar. In addition, aligning the field-of-view of two\ndatasets prior to training, results in a common linear relationship for both\ndomains.

The\nexisting works treat them as off-the-shelf feature extractors for each\nshort-trimmed snippet without capturing the fine-grained relation among\ndifferent snippets in a broader temporal context. To mitigate this issue, this\npaper focuses on designing a new mechanism for adapting these pre-trained ViT\nmodels as a unified long-form video transformer to fully unleash its modeling\npower in capturing inter-snippet relation, while still keeping low computation\noverhead and memory consumption for efficient TAD.

In this paper, we propose PlanKD, the first knowledge distillation\nframework tailored for compressing end-to-end motion planners. First,\nconsidering that driving scenes are inherently complex, often containing\nplanning-irrelevant or even noisy information, transferring such information is\nnot beneficial for the student planner. Thus, we design an information\nbottleneck based strategy to only distill planning-relevant information, rather\nthan transfer all information indiscriminately. Second, different waypoints in\nan output planned trajectory may hold varying degrees of importance for motion\nplanning, where a slight deviation in certain crucial waypoints might lead to a\ncollision. Therefore, we devise a safety-aware waypoint-attentive distillation\nmodule that assigns adaptive weights to different waypoints based on the\nimportance, to encourage the student to accurately mimic more crucial\nwaypoints, thereby improving overall safety.

The phenomenon has led\nto a correlation between user search and recommendation behaviors, providing an\nopportunity to model user interests in a fine-grained way. Existing approaches\neither model user search and recommendation behaviors separately or overlook\nthe different transitions between user search and recommendation behaviors. In\nthis paper, we propose a framework named UniSAR that effectively models the\ndifferent types of fine-grained behavior transitions for providing users a\nUnified Search And Recommendation service. Specifically, UniSAR models the user\ntransition behaviors between search and recommendation through three steps:\nextraction, alignment, and fusion, which are respectively implemented by\ntransformers equipped with pre-defined masks, contrastive learning that aligns\nthe extracted fine-grained user transitions, and cross-attentions that fuse\ndifferent transitions. To provide users with a unified service, the learned\nrepresentations are fed into the downstream search and recommendation models.\nJoint learning on both search and recommendation data is employed to utilize\nthe knowledge and enhance each other. Experimental results on two public\ndatasets demonstrated the effectiveness of UniSAR in terms of enhancing both\nsearch and recommendation simultaneously.

It assigns each document a unique identifier,\nknown as DocID, and employs a generative model to directly generate the\nrelevant DocID for the input query. A common choice for DocID is one or several\nnatural language sequences, e.g. the title or n-grams, so that the pre-trained\nknowledge of the generative model can be utilized. However, a sequence is\ngenerated token by token, where only the most likely candidates are kept and\nthe rest are pruned at each decoding step, thus, retrieval fails if any token\nwithin the relevant DocID is falsely pruned. What's worse, during decoding, the\nmodel can only perceive preceding tokens in DocID while being blind to\nsubsequent ones, hence is prone to make such errors. To address this problem,\nwe present a novel framework for generative retrieval, dubbed Term-Set\nGeneration (TSGen). Instead of sequences, we use a set of terms as DocID, which\nare automatically selected to concisely summarize the document's semantics and\ndistinguish it from others. On top of the term-set DocID, we propose a\npermutation-invariant decoding algorithm, with which the term set can be\ngenerated in any permutation yet will always lead to the corresponding\ndocument. Remarkably, TSGen perceives all valid terms rather than only the\npreceding ones at each decoding step. Given the constant decoding space, it can\nmake more reliable decisions due to the broader perspective. TSGen is also\nresilient to errors: the relevant DocID will not be pruned as long as the\ndecoded term belongs to it. Lastly, we design an iterative optimization\nprocedure to incentivize the model to generate the relevant term set in its\nfavorable permutation. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks,\nwhich validate the effectiveness, the generalizability, the scalability, and\nthe efficiency of TSGen.\n","authors":["Peitian Zhang","Zheng Liu","Yujia Zhou","Zhicheng Dou","Fangchao Liu","Zhao Cao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13859v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02046v3","updated":"2024-04-15T04:18:34Z","published":"2023-07-05T06:03:40Z","title":"Recommender Systems in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)","summary":"  With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems\n(RecSys) have become an important component of our daily life, providing\npersonalized suggestions that cater to user preferences.

Multi-domain learning is a typical solution in this regard.\nWhile considerable efforts have been made in this regard, there are still two\nlong-standing challenges: (1) Accurately depicting the differences among\ndomains using domain features is crucial for enhancing the performance of each\ndomain. However, manually designing domain features and models for numerous\ndomains can be a laborious task. (2) Users typically have limited impressions\nin only a few domains. Extracting features automatically from other domains and\nleveraging them to improve the predictive capabilities of each domain has\nconsistently posed a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an\nAutomatic Domain Feature Extraction and Personalized Integration (DFEI)\nframework for the large-scale multi-domain recommendation.

These explanations, however,\nentangle the potentially multiple factors that enter into the overall complex\ndecision strategy. We propose to disentangle explanations by extracting at some\nintermediate layer of a neural network, subspaces that capture the multiple and\ndistinct activation patterns (e.g. visual concepts) that are relevant to the\nprediction. To automatically extract these subspaces, we propose two new\nanalyses, extending principles found in PCA or ICA to explanations. These novel\nanalyses, which we call principal relevant component analysis (PRCA) and\ndisentangled relevant subspace analysis (DRSA), maximize relevance instead of\ne.g. variance or kurtosis. This allows for a much stronger focus of the\nanalysis on what the ML model actually uses for predicting, ignoring\nactivations or concepts to which the model is invariant.

Current quantization\nmethodologies primarily focus on model-side optimization, disregarding the\ntemporal dimension, such as the length of the timestep sequence, thereby\nallowing redundant timesteps to continue consuming computational resources,\nleaving substantial scope for accelerating the generative process. In this\npaper, we introduce TMPQ-DM, which jointly optimizes timestep reduction and\nquantization to achieve a superior performance-efficiency trade-off, addressing\nboth temporal and model optimization aspects.

Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional\nencodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) \\emph{Non-uniqueness}: there\nare many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2)\n\\emph{Instability}: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in\ncompletely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in\npositional encoding. Despite many attempts to address non-uniqueness, most\nmethods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph\nstructures. We identify the cause of instability to be a ``hard partition'' of\neigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings\n(SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to\n``softly partition'' eigenspaces.

Existing works aiming at addressing\nthis problem are usually based on global variance reduction, which requires a\nsubstantial amount of additional memory in a multiplicative factor equal to the\ntotal number of clients. An important open problem is to find a lightweight\nmethod for FL in the presence of clients with unknown participation rates. In\nthis paper, we address this problem by adapting the aggregation weights in\nfederated averaging (FedAvg) based on the participation history of each client.\nWe first show that, with heterogeneous participation statistics, FedAvg with\nnon-optimal aggregation weights can diverge from the optimal solution of the\noriginal FL objective, indicating the need of finding optimal aggregation\nweights. However, it is difficult to compute the optimal weights when the\nparticipation statistics are unknown. To address this problem, we present a new\nalgorithm called FedAU, which improves FedAvg by adaptively weighting the\nclient updates based on online estimates of the optimal weights without knowing\nthe statistics of client participation. We provide a theoretical convergence\nanalysis of FedAU using a novel methodology to connect the estimation error and\nconvergence. Our theoretical results reveal important and interesting insights,\nwhile showing that FedAU converges to an optimal solution of the original\nobjective and has desirable properties such as linear speedup.

Recent explorations have\nutilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by\npairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal\nconditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend\non static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and\nprioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level\nimage-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In\nthis paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these\nchallenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation\nstrategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the\ncapabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a\ncontextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and\ncross-semantic ambiguity mitigation.

The study reveals that LLMs produce arguments that require\nhigher cognitive effort, exhibiting more complex grammatical and lexical\nstructures than human counterparts. Additionally, LLMs demonstrate a\nsignificant propensity to engage more deeply with moral language, utilizing\nboth positive and negative moral foundations more frequently than humans. In\ncontrast with previous research, no significant difference was found in the\nemotional content produced by LLMs and humans. These findings contribute to the\ndiscourse on AI and persuasion, highlighting the dual potential of LLMs to both\nenhance and undermine informational integrity through communication strategies\nfor digital persuasion.\n","authors":["Carlos Carrasco-Farre"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09329v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04022v2","updated":"2024-04-14T17:30:24Z","published":"2024-04-05T11:06:07Z","title":"Good Books are Complex Matters: Gauging Complexity Profiles Across\n  Diverse Categories of Perceived Literary Quality","summary":"  In this study, we employ a classification approach to show that different\ncategories of literary \"quality\" display unique linguistic profiles, leveraging\na corpus that encompasses titles from the Norton Anthology, Penguin Classics\nseries, and the Open Syllabus project, contrasted against contemporary\nbestsellers, Nobel prize winners and recipients of prestigious literary awards.\nOur analysis reveals that canonical and so called high-brow texts exhibit\ndistinct textual features when compared to other quality categories such as\nbestsellers and popular titles as well as to control groups, likely responding\nto distinct (but not mutually exclusive) models of quality.

To obtain a knowledgeable agent, a promising approach is\nto leverage the knowledge from large language models (LLMs). Despite previous\nstudies combining LLMs with RL, seamless integration of the two components\nremains challenging due to their semantic gap. This paper introduces a novel\nmethod, Knowledgeable Agents from Language Model Rollouts (KALM), which\nextracts knowledge from LLMs in the form of imaginary rollouts that can be\neasily learned by the agent through offline reinforcement learning methods. The\nprimary challenge of KALM lies in LLM grounding, as LLMs are inherently limited\nto textual data, whereas environmental data often comprise numerical vectors\nunseen to LLMs. To address this, KALM fine-tunes the LLM to perform various\ntasks based on environmental data, including bidirectional translation between\nnatural language descriptions of skills and their corresponding rollout data.\nThis grounding process enhances the LLM's comprehension of environmental\ndynamics, enabling it to generate diverse and meaningful imaginary rollouts\nthat reflect novel skills. Initial empirical evaluations on the CLEVR-Robot\nenvironment demonstrate that KALM enables agents to complete complex\nrephrasings of task goals and extend their capabilities to novel tasks\nrequiring unprecedented optimal behaviors. KALM achieves a success rate of 46%\nin executing tasks with unseen goals, substantially surpassing the 26% success\nrate achieved by baseline methods.

Recently, stylized\nmeta-learning-like ICL setups have been devised that train transformers on\nsequences of input-output pairs $(x, f(x))$. The function $f$ comes from a\nfunction class and generalization is checked by evaluating on sequences\ngenerated from unseen functions from the same class. One of the main\ndiscoveries in this line of research has been that for several function\nclasses, such as linear regression, transformers successfully generalize to new\nfunctions in the class. However, the inductive biases of these models resulting\nin this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited training\ndata and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the pretraining\ndistribution. In this paper we empirically examine how far this Bayesian\nperspective can help us understand ICL. To this end, we generalize the previous\nmeta-ICL setup to hierarchical meta-ICL setup which involve unions of multiple\ntask families. We instantiate this setup on a diverse range of linear and\nnonlinear function families and find that transformers can do ICL in this\nsetting as well.

However, in spite of high\nefficiency, APRs and SCRs have limited accuracy especially in large-scale\noutdoor scenes; HMs are accurate but need to store a large number of 2D\ndescriptors for matching, resulting in poor efficiency. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient and accurate framework, called VRS-NeRF, for visual\nrelocalization with sparse neural radiance field. Precisely, we introduce an\nexplicit geometric map (EGM) for 3D map representation and an implicit learning\nmap (ILM) for sparse patches rendering. In this localization process, EGP\nprovides priors of spare 2D points and ILM utilizes these sparse points to\nrender patches with sparse NeRFs for matching. This allows us to discard a\nlarge number of 2D descriptors so as to reduce the map size. Moreover,\nrendering patches only for useful points rather than all pixels in the whole\nimage reduces the rendering time significantly. This framework inherits the\naccuracy of HMs and discards their low efficiency.

To infer TOs from observations, we\npropose to amortize the learning of TOs on generated datasets by sequentially\npredicting the leaves of graphs seen during training.

We propose a novel concept of reward regularization within\nthe robotic RLHF (RL from Human Feedback) framework, which we refer to as\n\\emph{agent preferences}. Our approach uniquely incorporates not just human\nfeedback in the form of preferences but also considers the preferences of the\nRL agent itself during the reward function learning process.

Among other attractive properties, when training a\nkernel-based model one is guaranteed to find the optimal model's parameters due\nto the convexity of the training landscape. However, this is based on the\nassumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from quantum\nhardware. In this work we study the performance of quantum kernel models from\nthe perspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values.\nWe show that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over\ndifferent input data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of\nqubits) towards some fixed value. Thus on training with a polynomial number of\nmeasurements, one ends up with a trivial model where the predictions on unseen\ninputs are independent of the input data. We identify four sources that can\nlead to concentration including: expressivity of data embedding, global\nmeasurements, entanglement and noise. For each source, an associated\nconcentration bound of quantum kernels is analytically derived.

To address this challenge, we introduce a\nPEFT method, Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA),\nwhich optimizes a significantly reduced parameter space while achieving or\nsurpassing the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning. PiSSA is inspired by\nIntrinsic SAID, which suggests that pre-trained, over-parametrized models\ninhabit a space of low intrinsic dimension. Consequently, PiSSA represents a\nmatrix W within the model by the product of two trainable matrices A and B,\nplus a residual matrix $W^{res}$ for error correction. SVD is employed to\nfactorize W, and the principal singular values and vectors of W are utilized to\ninitialize A and B. The residual singular values and vectors initialize the\nresidual matrix $W^{res}$, which keeps frozen during fine-tuning. Notably,\nPiSSA shares the same architecture with LoRA. However, LoRA approximates Delta\nW through the product of two matrices, A, initialized with Gaussian noise, and\nB, initialized with zeros, while PiSSA initializes A and B with principal\nsingular values and vectors of the original matrix W. PiSSA can better\napproximate the outcomes of full-parameter fine-tuning at the beginning by\nchanging the essential parts while freezing the \"noisy\" parts. In comparison,\nLoRA freezes the original matrix and updates the \"noise\". This distinction\nenables PiSSA to convergence much faster than LoRA and also achieve better\nperformance in the end. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA inherits many of\nLoRA's advantages, such as parameter efficiency and compatibility with\nquantization.

The\nprimary challenge of KALM lies in LLM grounding, as LLMs are inherently limited\nto textual data, whereas environmental data often comprise numerical vectors\nunseen to LLMs. To address this, KALM fine-tunes the LLM to perform various\ntasks based on environmental data, including bidirectional translation between\nnatural language descriptions of skills and their corresponding rollout data.\nThis grounding process enhances the LLM's comprehension of environmental\ndynamics, enabling it to generate diverse and meaningful imaginary rollouts\nthat reflect novel skills.

Compared to static data, streaming data, which is\nusually analyzed in data chunks, is more susceptible to encountering the\ndynamic cluster imbalanced issue. That is, the imbalanced degree of clusters\nvaries in different streaming data chunks, leading to corruption in either the\naccuracy or the efficiency of streaming data analysis based on existing\nclustering methods. Therefore, we propose an efficient approach called Learning\nSelf-Refined Organizing Map (LSROM) to handle the imbalanced streaming data\nclustering problem, where we propose an advanced SOM for representing the\nglobal data distribution. The constructed SOM is first refined for guiding the\npartition of the dataset to form many micro-clusters to avoid the missing small\nclusters in imbalanced data. Then an efficient merging of the micro-clusters is\nconducted through quick retrieval based on the SOM, which can automatically\nyield a true number of imbalanced clusters.

As a potential cause of the difficulty of applying\nthese models to VQA and similar tasks, we report an interesting phenomenon of\nvision-language models, which we call the Concept Association Bias (CAB). We\nfind that models with CAB tend to treat input as a bag of concepts and attempt\nto fill in the other missing concept crossmodally, leading to an unexpected\nzero-shot prediction. We demonstrate CAB by showing that CLIP's zero-shot\nclassification performance greatly suffers when there is a strong concept\nassociation between an object (e.g. eggplant) and an attribute (e.g. color\npurple). We also show that the strength of CAB predicts the performance on VQA.\nWe observe that CAB is prevalent in vision-language models trained with\ncontrastive losses, even when autoregressive losses are jointly employed.\nHowever, a model that solely relies on autoregressive loss seems to exhibit\nminimal or no signs of CAB.\n","authors":["Yutaro Yamada","Yingtian Tang","Yoyo Zhang","Ilker Yildirim"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12043v2.pdf","comment":"EMNLP 2023 main"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09043v1","updated":"2024-04-13T16:59:28Z","published":"2024-04-13T16:59:28Z","title":"Do LLMs Play Dice? Exploring Probability Distribution Sampling in Large\n  Language Models for Behavioral Simulation","summary":"  With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their\nremarkable capabilities in handling complex language tasks, an increasing\nnumber of studies are employing LLMs as agents to emulate the sequential\ndecision-making processes of humans often represented as Markov decision-making\nprocesses (MDPs). The actions within this decision-making framework adhere to\nspecific probability distributions and require iterative sampling. This arouses\nour curiosity regarding the capacity of LLM agents to comprehend probability\ndistributions, thereby guiding the agent's behavioral decision-making through\nprobabilistic sampling and generating behavioral sequences. To answer the above\nquestion, we divide the problem into two main aspects: simulation where the\nexact probability distribution is known, and generation of sequences where the\nprobability distribution is ambiguous. In the first case, the agent is required\nto give the type and parameters of the probability distribution through the\nproblem description, and then give the sampling sequence. However, our analysis\nshows that LLM agents perform poorly in this case, but the sampling success\nrate can be improved through programming tools. Real-world scenarios often\nentail unknown probability distributions. Thus, in the second case, we ask the\nagents to change the activity level in online social networks and analyze the\nfrequency of actions. Ultimately, our analysis shows that LLM agents cannot\nsample probability distributions even using programming tools. Therefore,\ncareful consideration is still required before directly applying LLM agents as\nagents to simulate human behavior.\n","authors":["Jia Gu","Liang Pang","Huawei Shen","Xueqi Cheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09043v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10435v4","updated":"2024-04-13T16:32:33Z","published":"2023-09-19T08:54:47Z","title":"Reformulating Sequential Recommendation: Learning Dynamic User Interest\n  with Content-enriched Language Modeling","summary":"  Recommender systems are indispensable in the realm of online applications,\nand sequential recommendation has enjoyed considerable prevalence due to its\ncapacity to encapsulate the dynamic shifts in user interests.

Extant approaches employ each modality equally without distinguishing the\namount of emotional information in these modalities, rendering it hard to\nadequately extract complementary information from multimodal data. To cope with\nthis problem, in CFN-ESA, we treat textual modality as the primary source of\nemotional information, while visual and acoustic modalities are taken as the\nsecondary sources. Besides, most multimodal ERC models ignore emotion-shift\ninformation and overfocus on contextual information, leading to the failure of\nemotion recognition under emotion-shift scenario. We elaborate an emotion-shift\nmodule to address this challenge. CFN-ESA mainly consists of unimodal encoder\n(RUME), cross-modal encoder (ACME), and emotion-shift module (LESM). RUME is\napplied to extract conversation-level contextual emotional cues while pulling\ntogether data distributions between modalities; ACME is utilized to perform\nmultimodal interaction centered on textual modality; LESM is used to model\nemotion shift and capture emotion-shift information, thereby guiding the\nlearning of the main task.

In this study we contend that\nsome form of 'latent complexity' can be approximated by using samples of simple\nand complex words. We use a sample of 'simple' words from primary school\npicture books and a sample of 'complex' words from high school and academic\nsettings. In order to analyse the differences between these classes, we look at\nthe letter positional probabilities (LPPs). We find strong statistical\nassociations between several LPPs and complexity. For example, simple words are\nsignificantly (p<.001) more likely to start with w, b, s, h, g, k, j, t, y or\nf, while complex words are significantly (p<.001) more likely to start with i,\na, e, r, v, u or d. We find similar strong associations for subsequent letter\npositions, with 84 letter-position variables in the first 6 positions being\nsignificant at the p<.001 level. We then use LPPs as variables in creating a\nclassifier which can classify the two classes with an 83% accuracy.

This task of layout prediction is valuable in text-to-image synthesis as\nit allows localized and controlled in-painting of the image. In this\ncomparative study it is shown that we can predict layouts from language\nrepresentations that implicitly or explicitly encode sentence syntax, if the\nsentences mention similar entity-relationships to the ones seen during\ntraining. To test compositional understanding, we collect a test set of\ngrammatically correct sentences and layouts describing compositions of entities\nand relations that unlikely have been seen during training. Performance on this\ntest set substantially drops, showing that current models rely on correlations\nin the training data and have difficulties in understanding the structure of\nthe input sentences. We propose a novel structural loss function that better\nenforces the syntactic structure of the input sentence and show large\nperformance gains in the task of 2D spatial layout prediction conditioned on\ntext.

Businesses are interested in future trends, traders are interested in\nfuture stock prices, and companies are highly interested in future\ntechnological breakthroughs. While there are many automated systems for\npredicting future numerical data, such as weather, stock prices, and demand for\nproducts, there is relatively little work in automatically predicting textual\ndata. Humans are interested in textual data predictions because it is a natural\nformat for our consumption, and experts routinely make predictions in a textual\nformat (Christensen et al., 2004; Tetlock & Gardner, 2015; Frick, 2015).\nHowever, there has been relatively little formalization of this general problem\nin the machine learning or natural language processing communities. To address\nthis gap, we introduce the task of future language modeling: probabilistic\nmodeling of texts in the future based on a temporal history of texts. To our\nknowledge, our work is the first work to formalize the task of predicting the\nfuture in this way.

Recent work has exploited the conversational context of a post to\nimprove this automatic tagging, e.g. using the replies to a post to help\nclassify if it contains toxic speech. This has shown particular potential in\nenvironments with large training sets that contain complete conversations.\nThis, however, creates challenges in a decentralised context, as a single\nconversation may be fragmented across multiple servers. Thus, each server only\nhas a partial view of an entire conversation because conversations are often\nfederated across servers in a non-synchronized fashion.

While it is possible to obtain annotation locally by directly\nasking users to provide preferred responses, such annotations have to be sparse\nto not affect user experience.

However, existing LLM serving engines\nfor executing multi-turn conversations are inefficient due to the need to\nrepeatedly compute the key-value (KV) caches of historical tokens, incurring\nhigh serving costs. To address the problem, this paper proposes AttentionStore,\na new attention mechanism that enables the reuse of KV caches (i.e., attention\nreuse) across multi-turn conversations, significantly reducing the repetitive\ncomputation overheads. AttentionStore maintains a hierarchical KV caching\nsystem that leverages cost-effective memory/storage mediums to save KV caches\nfor all requests. To reduce KV cache access overheads from slow mediums,\nAttentionStore employs layer-wise pre-loading and asynchronous saving schemes\nto overlap the KV cache access with the GPU computation. To ensure that the KV\ncaches to be accessed are placed in the fastest hierarchy, AttentionStore\nemploys scheduler-aware fetching and eviction schemes to consciously place the\nKV caches in different layers based on the hints from the inference job\nscheduler. To avoid the invalidation of the saved KV caches incurred by context\nwindow overflow, AttentionStore enables the saved KV caches to remain valid via\ndecoupling the positional encoding and effectively truncating the KV caches.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that AttentionStore significantly\ndecreases the time to the first token (TTFT) by up to 87%, improves the prompt\nprefilling throughput by 7.8$\\times$ for multi-turn conversations, and reduces\nthe end-to-end inference cost by up to 70%.

In this work, we propose Complementary Branch (CoBra), a novel dual\nbranch framework consisting of two distinct architectures which provide\nvaluable complementary knowledge of class (from CNN) and semantic (from ViT) to\neach branch. In particular, we learn Class-Aware Projection (CAP) for the CNN\nbranch and Semantic-Aware Projection (SAP) for the ViT branch to explicitly\nfuse their complementary knowledge and facilitate a new type of extra\npatch-level supervision. Our model, through CoBra, fuses CNN and ViT's\ncomplementary outputs to create robust pseudo masks that integrate both class\nand semantic information effectively. Extensive experiments qualitatively and\nquantitatively investigate how CNN and ViT complement each other on the PASCAL\nVOC 2012 dataset, showing a state-of-the-art WSSS result. This includes not\nonly the masks generated by our model, but also the segmentation results\nderived from utilizing these masks as pseudo labels.\n","authors":["Woojung Han","Seil Kang","Kyobin Choo","Seong Jae Hwang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08801v5.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14045v2","updated":"2024-04-16T14:45:44Z","published":"2024-02-21T13:06:48Z","title":"A Systematic Review of Low-Rank and Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation\n  in Big Data Medical Imaging","summary":"  The large volume and complexity of medical imaging datasets are bottlenecks\nfor storage, transmission, and processing.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce the Correlation Matrix Upsampling Flownet\n(CMU-Flownet), incorporating an occlusion estimation module within its cost\nvolume layer, alongside an Occlusion-aware Cost Volume (OCV) mechanism.\nSpecifically, we propose an enhanced upsampling approach that expands the\nsensory field of the sampling process which integrates a Correlation Matrix\ndesigned to evaluate point-level similarity.

Current\napproaches to image registration are generally based on the assumption that the\ncontent of the images is usually accessible in clear form, from which the\nspatial transformation is subsequently estimated. This common assumption may\nnot be met in practical applications, since the sensitive nature of medical\nimages may ultimately require their analysis under privacy constraints,\npreventing to openly share the image content.In this work, we formulate the\nproblem of image registration under a privacy preserving regime, where images\nare assumed to be confidential and cannot be disclosed in clear. We derive our\nprivacy preserving image registration framework by extending classical\nregistration paradigms to account for advanced cryptographic tools, such as\nsecure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, that enable the\nexecution of operations without leaking the underlying data. To overcome the\nproblem of performance and scalability of cryptographic tools in high\ndimensions, we propose several techniques to optimize the image registration\noperations by using gradient approximations, and by revisiting the use of\nhomomorphic encryption trough packing, to allow the efficient encryption and\nmultiplication of large matrices. We demonstrate our privacy preserving\nframework in linear and non-linear registration problems, evaluating its\naccuracy and scalability with respect to standard, non-private counterparts.\nOur results show that privacy preserving image registration is feasible and can\nbe adopted in sensitive medical imaging applications.\n","authors":["Riccardo Taiello","Melek Önen","Francesco Capano","Olivier Humbert","Marco Lorenzi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10120v7.pdf","comment":"v4 Accepted at Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted\n  Intervention (2022) 130-140"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10394v1","updated":"2024-04-16T08:52:42Z","published":"2024-04-16T08:52:42Z","title":"Portrait3D: Text-Guided High-Quality 3D Portrait Generation Using\n  Pyramid Representation and GANs Prior","summary":"  Existing neural rendering-based text-to-3D-portrait generation methods\ntypically make use of human geometry prior and diffusion models to obtain\nguidance.

To mitigate the \"grid-like\"\nartifact caused by the high-frequency information in the feature-map-based 3D\nrepresentation commonly used by most 3D-aware GANs, we integrate a novel\npyramid tri-grid 3D representation into 3DPortraitGAN-Pyramid.

However, in many cases, individuals may not\nwant to remove all degradations, for instance, a blurry lens revealing a\nbeautiful snowy landscape (double degradations). In such scenarios, people may\nonly desire to deblur. These situations and requirements shed light on a new\nchallenge in image restoration, where a model must perceive and remove specific\ndegradation types specified by human commands in images with multiple\ndegradations. We term this task Referring Flexible Image Restoration (RFIR). To\naddress this, we first construct a large-scale synthetic dataset called RFIR,\ncomprising 153,423 samples with the degraded image, text prompt for specific\ndegradation removal and restored image. RFIR consists of five basic degradation\ntypes: blur, rain, haze, low light and snow while six main sub-categories are\nincluded for varying degrees of degradation removal. To tackle the challenge,\nwe propose a novel transformer-based multi-task model named TransRFIR, which\nsimultaneously perceives degradation types in the degraded image and removes\nspecific degradation upon text prompt. TransRFIR is based on two devised\nattention modules, Multi-Head Agent Self-Attention (MHASA) and Multi-Head Agent\nCross Attention (MHACA), where MHASA and MHACA introduce the agent token and\nreach the linear complexity, achieving lower computation cost than vanilla\nself-attention and cross-attention and obtaining competitive performances.

Recently,\nresearchers have proposed high-quality instruction datasets, such as\nLRV-Instruction, to mitigate model hallucination. Nonetheless, our\ninvestigation reveals that hallucinatory concepts from different LVLMs exhibit\nspecificity, i.e. the distribution of hallucinatory concepts varies\nsignificantly across models. Existing datasets did not consider the\nhallucination specificity of different models in the design processes, thereby\ndiminishing their efficacy in mitigating model hallucination. In this paper, we\npropose a targeted instruction data generation framework named DFTG that\ntailored to the hallucination specificity of different models. Concretely, DFTG\nconsists of two stages: hallucination diagnosis, which extracts the necessary\ninformation from the model's responses and images for hallucination diagnosis;\nand targeted data generation, which generates targeted instruction data based\non diagnostic results. The experimental results on hallucination benchmarks\ndemonstrate that the targeted instruction data generated by our method are more\neffective in mitigating hallucinations compared to previous datasets.\n","authors":["Rui Hu","Yahan Tu","Jitao Sang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10332v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10322v1","updated":"2024-04-16T07:07:40Z","published":"2024-04-16T07:07:40Z","title":"Domain-Rectifying Adapter for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation","summary":"  Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) has achieved great success on segmenting\nobjects of novel classes, supported by only a few annotated samples. However,\nexisting FSS methods often underperform in the presence of domain shifts,\nespecially when encountering new domain styles that are unseen during training.\nIt is suboptimal to directly adapt or generalize the entire model to new\ndomains in the few-shot scenario. Instead, our key idea is to adapt a small\nadapter for rectifying diverse target domain styles to the source domain.\nConsequently, the rectified target domain features can fittingly benefit from\nthe well-optimized source domain segmentation model, which is intently trained\non sufficient source domain data. Training domain-rectifying adapter requires\nsufficiently diverse target domains. We thus propose a novel local-global style\nperturbation method to simulate diverse potential target domains by\nperturbating the feature channel statistics of the individual images and\ncollective statistics of the entire source domain, respectively.

Our key idea is to learn a mesh generator to fit an unorganized\ndeformable shape collection while constraining deformations between adjacent\nsynthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures such as local rigidity and\nlocal conformality. GenCorres presents three appealing advantages over existing\nJSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs JSM among a synthetic shape\ncollection whose size is much bigger than the input shapes and fully leverages\nthe datadriven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres unifies consistent shape\nmatching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing deformation priors between\nadjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator provides a concise encoding of\nconsistent shape correspondences. However, learning a mesh generator from an\nunorganized shape collection is challenging, requiring a good initialization.\nGenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit generator from the input\nshapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two arbitrary shapes. We\nintroduce a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent\nimplicit surfaces, which we use to regularize the implicit generator. Synthetic\nshapes of the implicit generator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via\ntemplate-based deformation) for learning the mesh generator.

Traditional detection methods face two main\nchallenges in adapting to these generators: the forensic traces of synthetic\nimages from new techniques can vastly differ from those learned during\ntraining, and access to data for these new generators is often limited. To\naddress these issues, we introduce the Ensemble of Expert Embedders (E3), a\nnovel continual learning framework for updating synthetic image detectors.

Our approach does this by first employing transfer\nlearning to develop a suite of expert embedders, each specializing in the\nforensic traces of a specific generator. Then, all embeddings are jointly\nanalyzed by an Expert Knowledge Fusion Network to produce accurate and reliable\ndetection decisions.

However, existing deep\nlearning methods typically generate drug features via aggregating molecular\natom representations, ignoring the chemical properties carried by motifs, i.e.,\nsubstructures of the molecular graph. The atom-drug double-level molecular\nrepresentation learning can not fully exploit structure information and fails\nto interpret the DTI mechanism from the motif perspective. In addition,\nsequential model-based target feature extraction either fuses limited\ncontextual information or requires expensive computational resources.

In this work, we consider\nendowing a neural network autoencoder with three select inductive biases from\nthe literature: data compression into a grid-like latent space via\nquantization, collective independence amongst latents, and minimal functional\ninfluence of any latent on how other latents determine data generation. In\nprinciple, these inductive biases are deeply complementary: they most directly\nspecify properties of the latent space, encoder, and decoder, respectively. In\npractice, however, naively combining existing techniques instantiating these\ninductive biases fails to yield significant benefits. To address this, we\npropose adaptations to the three techniques that simplify the learning problem,\nequip key regularization terms with stabilizing invariances, and quash\ndegenerate incentives.

Designers want fast tools that\ncan quickly give feedback on a design. Using the input and output data of the\ntools from past designs, one can attempt to build a machine learning model that\npredicts the outcome of a design in significantly shorter time than running the\ntool. The accuracy of such models is affected by the representation of the\ndesign data, which is usually a netlist that describes the elements of the\ndigital circuit and how they are connected. Graph representations for the\nnetlist together with graph neural networks have been investigated for such\nmodels.

The core concept of HGFL is to extract\nknowledge from rich-labeled classes in a source HG, transfer this knowledge to\na target HG to facilitate learning new classes with few-labeled training data,\nand finally make predictions on unlabeled testing data. Existing methods\ntypically assume that the source HG, training data, and testing data all share\nthe same distribution. However, in practice, distribution shifts among these\nthree types of data are inevitable due to two reasons: (1) the limited\navailability of the source HG that matches the target HG distribution, and (2)\nthe unpredictable data generation mechanism of the target HG. Such distribution\nshifts result in ineffective knowledge transfer and poor learning performance\nin existing methods, thereby leading to a novel problem of out-of-distribution\n(OOD) generalization in HGFL. To address this challenging problem, we propose a\nnovel Causal OOD Heterogeneous graph Few-shot learning model, namely COHF.

Traditional\npricing optimization, which heavily lean on linear and semi definite\nprogramming, encounter challenges in balancing profitability and fairness.\nThese challenges become especially pronounced in situations that necessitate\ncontinuous rate adjustments and the incorporation of fairness criteria.\nSpecifically, indirect Ratebook optimization, a widely-used method for new\nbusiness price setting, relies on predictor models such as XGBoost or GLMs/GAMs\nto estimate on downstream individually optimized prices. However, this strategy\nis prone to sequential errors and struggles to effectively manage optimizations\nfor continuous rate scenarios.

Moreover, to\ncircumvent infeasible solutions they often use relaxed constraints leading to\nsuboptimal pricing strategies. The reverse-engineered nature of traditional\nmodels complicates the enforcement of fairness and can lead to biased outcomes.\nOur method addresses these challenges by employing a direct optimization\nstrategy in the continuous space of rates and by embedding fairness through an\nadversarial predictor model.

However, in real-world applications,\nthe test distribution often differs from training. This problem, known as\nout-of-distribution generalization, challenges conventional models. Invariant\nRisk Minimization (IRM) emerges as a solution, aiming to identify features\ninvariant across different environments to enhance out-of-distribution\nrobustness. However, IRM's complexity, particularly its bi-level optimization,\nhas led to the development of various approximate methods. Our study\ninvestigates these approximate IRM techniques, employing the Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE) as a key metric. ECE, which measures the reliability of\nmodel prediction, serves as an indicator of whether models effectively capture\nenvironment-invariant features. Through a comparative analysis of datasets with\ndistributional shifts, we observe that Information Bottleneck-based IRM, which\ncondenses representational information, achieves a balance in improving ECE\nwhile preserving accuracy relatively. This finding is pivotal, as it\ndemonstrates a feasible path to maintaining robustness without compromising\naccuracy. Nonetheless, our experiments also caution against\nover-regularization, which can diminish accuracy.

However, in many cases, individuals may not\nwant to remove all degradations, for instance, a blurry lens revealing a\nbeautiful snowy landscape (double degradations). In such scenarios, people may\nonly desire to deblur. These situations and requirements shed light on a new\nchallenge in image restoration, where a model must perceive and remove specific\ndegradation types specified by human commands in images with multiple\ndegradations. We term this task Referring Flexible Image Restoration (RFIR). To\naddress this, we first construct a large-scale synthetic dataset called RFIR,\ncomprising 153,423 samples with the degraded image, text prompt for specific\ndegradation removal and restored image. RFIR consists of five basic degradation\ntypes: blur, rain, haze, low light and snow while six main sub-categories are\nincluded for varying degrees of degradation removal. To tackle the challenge,\nwe propose a novel transformer-based multi-task model named TransRFIR, which\nsimultaneously perceives degradation types in the degraded image and removes\nspecific degradation upon text prompt. TransRFIR is based on two devised\nattention modules, Multi-Head Agent Self-Attention (MHASA) and Multi-Head Agent\nCross Attention (MHACA), where MHASA and MHACA introduce the agent token and\nreach the linear complexity, achieving lower computation cost than vanilla\nself-attention and cross-attention and obtaining competitive performances. Our\nTransRFIR achieves state-of-the-art performances compared with other\ncounterparts and is proven as an effective architecture for image restoration.\nWe release our project at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/FIR-CP.\n","authors":["Runwei Guan","Rongsheng Hu","Zhuhao Zhou","Tianlang Xue","Ka Lok Man","Jeremy Smith","Eng Gee Lim","Weiping Ding","Yutao Yue"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10342v1.pdf","comment":"15 pages, 19 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10292v1","updated":"2024-04-16T05:29:14Z","published":"2024-04-16T05:29:14Z","title":"From Data Deluge to Data Curation: A Filtering-WoRA Paradigm for\n  Efficient Text-based Person Search","summary":"  In text-based person search endeavors, data generation has emerged as a\nprevailing practice, addressing concerns over privacy preservation and the\narduous task of manual annotation. Although the number of synthesized data can\nbe infinite in theory, the scientific conundrum persists that how much\ngenerated data optimally fuels subsequent model training.

Given a review and the sentiment associated with it,\nthis paper formulates SA as a combination of two tasks: (1) a causal discovery\ntask that distinguishes whether a review \"primes\" the sentiment (Causal\nHypothesis C1), or the sentiment \"primes\" the review (Causal Hypothesis C2);\nand (2) the traditional prediction task to model the sentiment using the review\nas input. Using the peak-end rule in psychology, we classify a sample as C1 if\nits overall sentiment score approximates an average of all the sentence-level\nsentiments in the review, and C2 if the overall sentiment score approximates an\naverage of the peak and end sentiments. For the prediction task, we use the\ndiscovered causal mechanisms behind the samples to improve the performance of\nLLMs by proposing causal prompts that give the models an inductive bias of the\nunderlying causal graph, leading to substantial improvements by up to 32.13 F1\npoints on zero-shot five-class SA.

Then, we leverage two local attention mechanisms\nbased on efficient 1D convolutions to facilitate comprehensive feature\nextraction at the temporal and channel levels independently. 2) We introduce\nthe Cross Convolutional Fusion (CCF) layer as a novel approach to model the\ninter-dependencies between the temporal and channel scopes.

While they have been intensively studied in\nclassification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely\noverlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every\npixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on\nsegmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a\nspecific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed\nInfluencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the\nclassification accuracy of non-victim pixels and mislead classifications of all\nvictim pixels in every single inference and could be easily applied to\nreal-world scenes. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentation\nmodels, we proposed a simple, yet effective, Nearest-Neighbor trigger injection\nstrategy. We also introduce an innovative Pixel Random Labeling strategy which\nmaintains optimal performance even when the trigger is placed far from the\nvictim pixels. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation\nmodels do suffer from backdoor attacks, demonstrate IBA real-world\napplicability, and show that our proposed techniques can further increase\nattack performance.\n","authors":["Haoheng Lan","Jindong Gu","Philip Torr","Hengshuang Zhao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12054v5.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11461v1","updated":"2024-04-17T15:09:31Z","published":"2024-04-17T15:09:31Z","title":"Using Game Engines and Machine Learning to Create Synthetic Satellite\n  Imagery for a Tabletop Verification Exercise","summary":"  Satellite imagery is regarded as a great opportunity for citizen-based\nmonitoring of activities of interest.

Next, we\nemploy an enhanced version of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to distill knowledge\ninto the student in a few-shot scenario, aiming to recover the information\nprocessing carried out by the skipped teacher layers. We present comprehensive\nexperiments with supervised and self-supervised transformers as teachers, on\nfive data sets from various domains, including natural, medical and satellite\nimages. The empirical results confirm the superiority of our approach over\ncompetitive baselines. Moreover, the ablation results demonstrate the\nusefulness of each component of the proposed pipeline.\n","authors":["Diana-Nicoleta Grigore","Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu","Jon Alvarez Justo","Tor Johansen","Andreea Iuliana Ionescu","Radu Tudor Ionescu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09326v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03788v2","updated":"2024-04-17T07:41:48Z","published":"2024-01-08T10:08:48Z","title":"Low-light Image Enhancement via CLIP-Fourier Guided Wavelet Diffusion","summary":"  Low-light image enhancement techniques have significantly progressed, but\nunstable image quality recovery and unsatisfactory visual perception are still\nsignificant challenges. To solve these problems, we propose a novel and robust\nlow-light image enhancement method via CLIP-Fourier Guided Wavelet Diffusion,\nabbreviated as CFWD. Specifically, CFWD leverages multimodal visual-language\ninformation in the frequency domain space created by multiple wavelet\ntransforms to guide the enhancement process. Multi-scale supervision across\ndifferent modalities facilitates the alignment of image features with semantic\nfeatures during the wavelet diffusion process, effectively bridging the gap\nbetween degraded and normal domains.

Addressing\nthis gap, we introduce the Multi-Level Concept Prototypes Classifier (MCPNet),\nan inherently interpretable model. MCPNet autonomously learns meaningful\nconcept prototypes across multiple feature map levels using Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA) loss and an energy-based weighted PCA mechanism, and it does so\nwithout reliance on predefined concept labels. Further, we propose a novel\nclassifier paradigm that learns and aligns multi-level concept prototype\ndistributions for classification purposes via Class-aware Concept Distribution\n(CCD) loss. Our experiments reveal that our proposed MCPNet while being\nadaptable to various model architectures, offers comprehensive multi-level\nexplanations while maintaining classification accuracy. Additionally, its\nconcept distribution-based classification approach shows improved\ngeneralization capabilities in few-shot classification scenarios.\n","authors":["Bor-Shiun Wang","Chien-Yi Wang","Wei-Chen Chiu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08968v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by CVPR 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11070v1","updated":"2024-04-17T04:59:36Z","published":"2024-04-17T04:59:36Z","title":"Sky-GVIO: an enhanced GNSS/INS/Vision navigation with FCN-based\n  sky-segmentation in urban canyon","summary":"  Accurate, continuous, and reliable positioning is a critical component of\nachieving autonomous driving.

One of the most important\ntradeoffs in PET imaging is between image quality and radiation dose: high\nimage quality comes with high radiation exposure. Improving image quality is\ndesirable for all clinical applications while minimizing radiation exposure is\nneeded to reduce risk to patients. Approach: We introduce PET Consistency Model\n(PET-CM), an efficient diffusion-based method for generating high-quality\nfull-dose PET images from low-dose PET images. It employs a two-step process,\nadding Gaussian noise to full-dose PET images in the forward diffusion, and\nthen denoising them using a PET Shifted-window Vision Transformer (PET-VIT)\nnetwork in the reverse diffusion. The PET-VIT network learns a consistency\nfunction that enables direct denoising of Gaussian noise into clean full-dose\nPET images. PET-CM achieves state-of-the-art image quality while requiring\nsignificantly less computation time than other methods. Results: In experiments\ncomparing eighth-dose to full-dose images, PET-CM demonstrated impressive\nperformance with NMAE of 1.278+/-0.122%, PSNR of 33.783+/-0.824dB, SSIM of\n0.964+/-0.009, NCC of 0.968+/-0.011, HRS of 4.543, and SUV Error of\n0.255+/-0.318%, with an average generation time of 62 seconds per patient.

However,\nthese behaviors inevitably exhibit popularity bias, leading to some unfairness\nissues: 1) for items with similar quality, more popular ones get more exposure;\nand 2) even worse the popular items with lower popularity might receive more\nexposure. Existing work on mitigating popularity bias blindly eliminates the\nbias and usually ignores the effect of item quality. We argue that the\nrelationships between different user behaviors (e.g., conversion rate) actually\nreflect the item quality. Therefore, to handle the unfairness issues, we\npropose to mitigate the popularity bias by considering multiple user behaviors.\n  In this work, we examine causal relationships behind the interaction\ngeneration procedure in multi-behavior recommendation. Specifically, we find\nthat: 1) item popularity is a confounder between the exposed items and users'\npost-click interactions, leading to the first unfairness; and 2) some hidden\nconfounders (e.g., the reputation of item producers) affect both item\npopularity and quality, resulting in the second unfairness. To alleviate these\nconfounding issues, we propose a causal framework to estimate the causal\neffect, which leverages backdoor adjustment to block the backdoor paths caused\nby the confounders.

Secondly, previous approaches fail to take into account the\nsignificant distribution differences between behavior and modality when they\nattempt to fuse behavior and modality information.

In current society, individuals frequently express negative\nemotions on social media on specific topics, often exhibiting cognitive\ndistortions, including suicidal behaviors in extreme cases. Yet, there is a\nnotable absence of methodologies for analyzing cognitive pathways that could\naid psychotherapists in conducting effective interventions online. In this\nstudy, we gathered data from social media and established the task of\nextracting cognitive pathways, annotating the data based on a cognitive\ntheoretical framework. We initially categorized the task of extracting\ncognitive pathways as a hierarchical text classification with four main\ncategories and nineteen subcategories. Following this, we structured a text\nsummarization task to help psychotherapists quickly grasp the essential\ninformation. Our experiments evaluate the performance of deep learning and\nlarge language models (LLMs) on these tasks. The results demonstrate that our\ndeep learning method achieved a micro-F1 score of 62.34% in the hierarchical\ntext classification task. Meanwhile, in the text summarization task, GPT-4\nattained a Rouge-1 score of 54.92 and a Rouge-2 score of 30.86, surpassing the\nexperimental deep learning model's performance. However, it may suffer from an\nissue of hallucination.

A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its\naccuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve\ncalibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to\ncomputational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling\nstrategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an\nextension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates\ncalibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization\nfor OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of\ncalibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is\nconstructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian\nlearning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization\n(OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to\nproduce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs\nfor which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical\nresults illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD\ncalibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods.

To investigate this, in this paper, we build a parallel model to\nilluminate and understand the internal operation of neural networks, such as\nthe RNN, which store their internal state in order to process sequential\ninputs. This model is widely applicable in that it can be used with any input\ndomain where the inputs can be represented by a Gaussian mixture. By looking at\nthe RNN processing from a probability density function perspective, we are able\nto show how each layer of the RNN transforms the input distributions to\nincrease detection accuracy. At the same time we also discover a side effect\nacting to limit the improvement in accuracy. To demonstrate the fidelity of the\nmodel we validate it against each stage of RNN processing as well as the output\npredictions.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by\nleveraging a labelled dataset from a related domain to detect anomalies in a\ntarget dataset. Existing domain adaptation techniques assume that the number of\nanomalous classes does not change between the source and target domains. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning for\nAnomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD) model to address this\nissue by combining UDA and contrastive representation learning. DACAD's\napproach includes an anomaly injection mechanism that introduces various types\nof synthetic anomalies, enhancing the model's ability to generalise across\nunseen anomalous classes in different domains.

By splitting the model\ninto different submodels between the server and EDs, our approach jointly\noptimizes user-side workload and server-side computing resource allocation by\nconsidering users' heterogeneity. We formulate the whole optimization problem\nas a mixed-integer non-linear program, which is an NP-hard problem, and develop\nan iterative approach to obtain an approximate solution efficiently. Extensive\nsimulations have been conducted to validate the significantly increased\nefficiency of our ESFL approach compared with standard federated learning,\nsplit learning, and splitfed learning.\n","authors":["Guangyu Zhu","Yiqin Deng","Xianhao Chen","Haixia Zhang","Yuguang Fang","Tan F.

This captures common issues of data collection, such as\nhaving human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that\nresult in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according\nto different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference\nlearning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF),\nimplicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule\ncalled Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are\nvery different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected\nutility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning\nfrom users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function.

We then demonstrate that an\nencoder-only non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a\nlow-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and\npedals with high accuracy and time precision. The experiment shows that our\napproach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks in\nterms of the F1 measure on the Maestro dataset.\n","authors":["Yujia Yan","Zhiyao Duan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09466v2.pdf","comment":"Fixed Typos"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14301v2","updated":"2024-04-17T00:55:09Z","published":"2024-02-22T05:41:24Z","title":"GenSERP: Large Language Models for Whole Page Presentation","summary":"  The advent of large language models (LLMs) brings an opportunity to minimize\nthe effort in search engine result page (SERP) organization.

Its main goal is to integrate multi-modalities to identify human\nemotional states. Current works generally assume accurate emotion labels for\nbenchmark datasets and focus on developing more effective architectures.\nHowever, emotions have inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. To obtain more\nreliable labels, existing datasets usually restrict the label space to some\nbasic categories, then hire multiple annotators and use majority voting to\nselect the most likely label. However, this process may cause some correct but\nnon-candidate or non-majority labels to be ignored. To improve reliability\nwithout ignoring subtle emotions, we propose a new task called\n``\\textbf{Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (EMER)}''. In contrast to\ntraditional tasks that focus on predicting emotions, EMER takes a step further\nby providing explanations for these predictions. Through this task, we can\nextract more reliable labels since each label has a certain basis. Meanwhile,\nwe use LLMs to disambiguate unimodal descriptions and generate more complete\nmultimodal EMER descriptions. From them, we can extract subtle labels,\nproviding a promising approach for open-set emotion recognition.

Previous works\nsuffer from two major issues. Firstly, the training process tightly couples the\nbehavior module and multimodal module by jointly optimizing them using the\nsharing model parameters, which leads to suboptimal performance since behavior\nsignals and modality signals often provide opposite guidance for the parameters\nupdates. Secondly, previous approaches fail to take into account the\nsignificant distribution differences between behavior and modality when they\nattempt to fuse behavior and modality information. This resulted in a\nmisalignment between the representations of behavior and modality. To address\nthese challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Dual Representation\nlearning framework for Multimodal Recommendation called DRepMRec, which\nintroduce separate dual lines for coupling problem and Behavior-Modal Alignment\n(BMA) for misalignment problem. Specifically, DRepMRec leverages two\nindependent lines of representation learning to calculate behavior and modal\nrepresentations. After obtaining separate behavior and modal representations,\nwe design a Behavior-Modal Alignment Module (BMA) to align and fuse the dual\nrepresentations to solve the misalignment problem. Furthermore, we integrate\nthe BMA into other recommendation models, resulting in consistent performance\nimprovements. To ensure dual representations maintain their semantic\nindependence during alignment, we introduce Similarity-Supervised Signal (SSS)\nfor representation learning.

So in this work, we leverage 100B+\nGPT variants to act as synthetic feedback experts offering expert-level edit\nfeedback, that is used to reduce hallucinations and align weaker (<10B\nparameter) LLMs with medical facts using two distinct alignment algorithms (DPO\n& SALT), endeavoring to narrow the divide between AI-generated content and\nfactual accuracy. This highlights the substantial potential of LLM-based\nsynthetic edits in enhancing the alignment of clinical factuality.\n","authors":["Prakamya Mishra","Zonghai Yao","Parth Vashisht","Feiyun Ouyang","Beining Wang","Vidhi Dhaval Mody","Hong Yu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13919v3.pdf","comment":"Equal contribution for the first two authors"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12299v1","updated":"2024-04-18T16:24:12Z","published":"2024-04-18T16:24:12Z","title":"Simultaneous Interpretation Corpus Construction by Large Language Models\n  in Distant Language Pair","summary":"  In Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) systems, training with a\nsimultaneous interpretation (SI) corpus is an effective method for achieving\nhigh-quality yet low-latency systems.

We\nevaluate the LLMs' predictive and calibration accuracy on five CD/CW datasets\nfrom diverse domains, each utilizing a different worthiness criterion. We\ninvestigate two key aspects: (1) how best to distill factuality and worthiness\ncriteria into a prompt and (2) what amount of context to provide for each\nclaim. To this end, we experiment with varying the level of prompt verbosity\nand the amount of contextual information provided to the model. Our results\nshow that optimal prompt verbosity is domain-dependent, adding context does not\nimprove performance, and confidence scores can be directly used to produce\nreliable check-worthiness rankings.\n","authors":["Laura Majer","Jan Šnajder"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12174v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12171v1","updated":"2024-04-18T13:25:29Z","published":"2024-04-18T13:25:29Z","title":"Stance Detection on Social Media with Fine-Tuned Large Language Models","summary":"  Stance detection, a key task in natural language processing, determines an\nauthor's viewpoint based on textual analysis.

In this thesis, I explore several approaches to\naligning LMs with human preferences. First, I argue that aligning LMs can be\nseen as Bayesian inference: conditioning a prior (base, pretrained LM) on\nevidence about human preferences (Chapter 2). Conditioning on human preferences\ncan be implemented in numerous ways. In Chapter 3, I investigate the relation\nbetween two approaches to finetuning pretrained LMs using feedback given by a\nscoring function: reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and\ndistribution matching. I show that RLHF can be seen as a special case of\ndistribution matching but distributional matching is strictly more general. In\nchapter 4, I show how to extend the distribution matching to conditional\nlanguage models.

This suggests that LLMs, even after\nthorough safety alignment, could still pose potential risks to society upon\npublic release. To evaluate the harmfulness of outputs resulting with various\nattack methods, we propose a comprehensive evaluation method that reduces the\npotential inaccuracies of existing evaluations, and further validate that our\nmethod causes more harmful content. Additionally, we discover that the SCAVs\nshow some transferability across different open-source LLMs.\n","authors":["Zhihao Xu","Ruixuan Huang","Xiting Wang","Fangzhao Wu","Jing Yao","Xing Xie"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12038v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12022v1","updated":"2024-04-18T09:17:06Z","published":"2024-04-18T09:17:06Z","title":"Parallel Decoding via Hidden Transfer for Lossless Large Language Model\n  Acceleration","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance\nacross a wide range of tasks.

However, conversational agents built upon\neven the most recent large language models (LLMs) face challenges in processing\nambiguous inputs, primarily due to the following two hurdles: (1) LLMs are not\ndirectly trained to handle inputs that are too ambiguous to be properly\nmanaged; (2) the degree of ambiguity in an input can vary according to the\nintrinsic knowledge of the LLMs, which is difficult to investigate. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a method to align LLMs to explicitly handle\nambiguous inputs.

However, finding the prompt\nwith the lowest perplexity is challenging, given the enormous space of possible\nprompting phrases. In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara),\nan end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions\ninto their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase\nLM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or\ninstruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The\nensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt\nwithout altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decreasing the\nperplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore in\ndetail both greedy and search-based decoding as two alternative decoding\nschemes of MonoPara.

Given the capabilities of neural fields in densely representing a 3D\nscene from 2D images, we ask the question: Can we scale their self-supervised\npretraining, specifically using masked autoencoders, to generate effective 3D\nrepresentations from posed RGB images. Owing to the astounding success of\nextending transformers to novel data modalities, we employ standard 3D Vision\nTransformers to suit the unique formulation of NeRFs.

Benchmarking their performance is essential\nfor selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this\ntask. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore,\nthe primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked\nfor semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various\nsettings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and\ntraining time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to\nfine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear\ndecoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more\nadvanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more\nthan 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also\nrecommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts\nvaries.

For high-resolution RS\nimages, partly or totally changed objects are more worthy of attention rather\nthan a single pixel.

Furthermore, we propose a\nnew dataset, Tank3D, to further explore the network's ability to handle more\ncomplicated scenes. The experiments demonstrate that our approach not only\nattains a quantitative enhancement in various metrics, surpassing the\nstate-of-the-art methods but also signifies a qualitative leap in neural\nnetwork-based simulation by faithfully adhering to the physical laws.

Lastly, through comprehensive experiments on the OCTA\ndataset, our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving improvements of up to 12.28% in overall accuracy. This\nadvancement lays the groundwork for the future utilization of OCTA in\ndiagnosing sleep-related disorders.

Existing event-based lip-reading\nsolutions integrate different frame rate branches to learn spatio-temporal\nfeatures of varying granularities. However, aggregating events into event\nframes inevitably leads to the loss of fine-grained temporal information within\nframes. To remedy this drawback, we propose a novel framework termed Multi-view\nTemporal Granularity aligned Aggregation (MTGA). Specifically, we first present\na novel event representation method, namely time-segmented voxel graph list,\nwhere the most significant local voxels are temporally connected into a graph\nlist. Then we design a spatio-temporal fusion module based on temporal\ngranularity alignment, where the global spatial features extracted from event\nframes, together with the local relative spatial and temporal features\ncontained in voxel graph list are effectively aligned and integrated. Finally,\nwe design a temporal aggregation module that incorporates positional encoding,\nwhich enables the capture of local absolute spatial and global temporal\ninformation.

To\ncounter these perturbations, robust multi-modal representations are highly\nexpected, which are positioned well away from the discriminative multi-modal\ndecision boundary. In this paper, different from conventional empirical\nstudies, we focus on a commonly used joint multi-modal framework and\ntheoretically discover that larger uni-modal representation margins and more\nreliable integration for modalities are essential components for achieving\nhigher robustness. This discovery can further explain the limitation of\nmulti-modal robustness and the phenomenon that multi-modal models are often\nvulnerable to attacks on the specific modality. Moreover, our analysis reveals\nhow the widespread issue, that the model has different preferences for\nmodalities, limits the multi-modal robustness by influencing the essential\ncomponents and could lead to attacks on the specific modality highly effective.\nInspired by our theoretical finding, we introduce a training procedure called\nCertifiable Robust Multi-modal Training (CRMT), which can alleviate this\ninfluence from modality preference and explicitly regulate essential components\nto significantly improve robustness in a certifiable manner.

Specifically, existing methods have high computational\ndemands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occluded\nregions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalable\ntransformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3D\nreconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane from\nonly six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor driving\nscenarios.

A core difficulty in LTR is\ngradient estimation, for this reason, existing stochastic LTR methods have been\nlimited to differentiable ranking models (e.g., neural networks).

To tackle this problem, we propose a parallel inference network\ncustomized for semantic segmentation tasks to achieve a good trade-off between\nspeed and accuracy. We employ a shallow backbone to ensure real-time speed, and\npropose three core components to compensate for the reduced model capacity to\nimprove accuracy. Specifically, we first design a dual-pyramidal path\narchitecture (Multi-level Feature Aggregation Module, MFAM) to aggregate\nmulti-level features from the encoder to each scale, providing hierarchical\nclues for subsequent spatial alignment and corresponding in-network inference.\nThen, we build Recursive Alignment Module (RAM) by combining the flow-based\nalignment module with recursive upsampling architecture for accurate spatial\nalignment between multi-scale feature maps with half the computational\ncomplexity of the straightforward alignment method. Finally, we perform\nindependent parallel inference on the aligned features to obtain multi-scale\nscores, and adaptively fuse them through an attention-based Adaptive Scores\nFusion Module (ASFM) so that the final prediction can favor objects of multiple\nscales.

Benchmarking their performance is essential\nfor selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this\ntask. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore,\nthe primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked\nfor semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various\nsettings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and\ntraining time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to\nfine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear\ndecoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more\nadvanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more\nthan 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also\nrecommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts\nvaries. Linear probing, a common practice for some VFMs, is not recommended, as\nit is not representative of end-to-end fine-tuning. The benchmarking setup\nrecommended in this paper enables a performance analysis of VFMs for semantic\nsegmentation. The findings of such an analysis reveal that pretraining with\npromptable segmentation is not beneficial, whereas masked image modeling (MIM)\nwith abstract representations is crucial, even more important than the type of\nsupervision used.

In this thesis, I explore several approaches to\naligning LMs with human preferences.

Conditioning on human preferences\ncan be implemented in numerous ways. In Chapter 3, I investigate the relation\nbetween two approaches to finetuning pretrained LMs using feedback given by a\nscoring function: reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and\ndistribution matching. I show that RLHF can be seen as a special case of\ndistribution matching but distributional matching is strictly more general. In\nchapter 4, I show how to extend the distribution matching to conditional\nlanguage models.

Moreover, our analysis reveals\nhow the widespread issue, that the model has different preferences for\nmodalities, limits the multi-modal robustness by influencing the essential\ncomponents and could lead to attacks on the specific modality highly effective.\nInspired by our theoretical finding, we introduce a training procedure called\nCertifiable Robust Multi-modal Training (CRMT), which can alleviate this\ninfluence from modality preference and explicitly regulate essential components\nto significantly improve robustness in a certifiable manner. Our method\ndemonstrates substantial improvements in performance and robustness compared\nwith existing methods. Furthermore, our training procedure can be easily\nextended to enhance other robust training strategies, highlighting its\ncredibility and flexibility.\n","authors":["Zequn Yang","Yake Wei","Ce Liang","Di Hu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06244v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted to ICLR 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11938v1","updated":"2024-04-18T06:38:02Z","published":"2024-04-18T06:38:02Z","title":"HyDiscGAN: A Hybrid Distributed cGAN for Audio-Visual Privacy\n  Preservation in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis","summary":"  Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify speakers' sentiment\ntendencies in multimodal video content, raising serious concerns about privacy\nrisks associated with multimodal data, such as voiceprints and facial images.\nRecent distributed collaborative learning has been verified as an effective\nparadigm for privacy preservation in multimodal tasks. However, they often\noverlook the privacy distinctions among different modalities, struggling to\nstrike a balance between performance and privacy preservation. Consequently, it\nposes an intriguing question of maximizing multimodal utilization to improve\nperformance while simultaneously protecting necessary modalities. This paper\nforms the first attempt at modality-specified (i.e., audio and visual) privacy\npreservation in MSA tasks. We propose a novel Hybrid Distributed cross-modality\ncGAN framework (HyDiscGAN), which learns multimodality alignment to generate\nfake audio and visual features conditioned on shareable de-identified textual\ndata. The objective is to leverage the fake features to approximate real audio\nand visual content to guarantee privacy preservation while effectively\nenhancing performance. Extensive experiments show that compared with the\nstate-of-the-art MSA model, HyDiscGAN can achieve superior or competitive\nperformance while preserving privacy.\n","authors":["Zhuojia Wu","Qi Zhang","Duoqian Miao","Kun Yi","Wei Fan","Liang Hu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11938v1.pdf","comment":"13 pages, IJCAI-2024"}]}}
